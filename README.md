# Generative-AI-Powered Procurement Assistant
## This project aims to create an assistant that can optimize procurement processes by learning from past procurement data. 

**Problem**

Because of asymmetric information between government and the private sector, estimating the expected cost of a service/commodity being proccured can be resource intensive, and in some cases require large - sometimes poorly evidenced - assumptions. We have identitifed this an opportunity to leverage AI to build institutional knowledge on past procurement, learning from past success and failure. 

**Proposed Solution**

This tool allows users to input basic information about a new procurement need (title, description, category). The assistant matches it to similar past procurements. It also provides an analysis of potential risks and estimated price ranges based on historical data.

**Key features:**

* NLP parsing of unstructured procurement documents
* Matching user input to similar past procurements
* Providing examples of relevant past artifacts
* Risk analysis based on procurement domain knowledge
* Price estimation based on inflation-adjusted historical data
