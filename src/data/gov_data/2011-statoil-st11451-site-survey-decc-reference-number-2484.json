The block number traversed was 9/11. This was a shallow drilling survey without any seismic sources. It drilled 8 shallow boreholes to maximum depth of 102m below the seafloor for a planned jacket location. All borings were within a 209m radius of the planned wellbay centre. No borings were drilled for anchor locations. 11 samples of the seabed surface were taken along a planned pipeline route.", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "name": "british-geological-survey", "title": "British Geological Survey (BGS)", "type": "organization", "description": "A world-leading geoscience centre for survey and monitoring; modelling and research; data and knowledge.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/home.html\r\n\r\n", "image_url": "2020-08-17-104120.024946BGS-Logo-Pos-RGB-01.png", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:32.295517", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2011-05-19"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2011-06-05"], "title": "2011, Statoil, ST11451, Site Survey, DECC Reference Number 2484", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"The copyright of materials derived from the British Geological Survey's work is vested in the Natural Environment Research Council [NERC].
