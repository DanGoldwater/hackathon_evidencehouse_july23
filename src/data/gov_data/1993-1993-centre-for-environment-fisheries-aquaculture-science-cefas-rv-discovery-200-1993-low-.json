Data were collected using \nthe lowered CTD rosette system which is used when the vessel is stationary. \nUsually bottles were fired at particular depths and samples taken for \ncalibration. In early years only a limited set of parameters were collected. \nNotably Pressure (Depth), Temperature and Conductivity (CTD). From \nConductivity Salinity can be calculated using the UNESCO 1978,1983 \nformulations . In subsequent years more sensors have been added, notably \nfluorometers, Optical back scatter or transmissometers and Light (PAR, photo \nsynthetically available radiation). The exact configuration varies between \ncruises and this is reflected in the data format of the output files.\n\nData was collected from research vessels on station, a profile from the \nsurface to near the sea bed is undertaken. The down cast data should be a \nclean profile. Water bottles for sample collection and calibration are fired \non the up cast.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "110", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "-30", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "-70", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "10", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-01-02\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS24498056-ca4c-4a4a-bf90-c577a8d0387b", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-01-02T14:34:22", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[110, -70], [10, -70], [10, -30], [110, -30], [110, -70]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "58ea9f1c-cdbe-4226-85ef-0f46e401d91a", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "e5b0b5aa-e162-4093-b8f5-a0c0305ecb8e"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
