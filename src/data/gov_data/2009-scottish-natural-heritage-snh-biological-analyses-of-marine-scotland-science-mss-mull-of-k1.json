An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by MSS for MSS on the 13th October 2009 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 6 sites in the area. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
