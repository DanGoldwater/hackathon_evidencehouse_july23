The fishermen theorised using a \nlarge mesh net in the channel, would be a feasible alternative to fishing the \nNorth Sea, were the minimising of the bycatch of cod is a problem.\n\nFrom late February through to mid March 2012, 100 hauls were observed by Cefas \nscientists. Catch varied from one wreck to the next. But overall the Jubilee \nPride successfully demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a targeted \nfishery for pollack. Catches were dominated by pollack and bib. Pollack \naccounted for nearly 90% of the total landed weight of fish. Bib on the other \nhand was mostly discarded, accounting for just 0.7% of the total landed weight \nof fish. After pollack, the next biggest landing was ling accounting for 6% of \nthe total landed weight of fish. The contribution of cod to the total landed \nweight of fish was just over 1% (just 20 individuals taken throughout the \nsurvey).\n\nThe bycatch of sensitive species such as marine mammals and sharks was \nminimal, with no mammals caught and just a few tope and spurdog.\n\n\n\n", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "type": "organization", "description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "image_url": "", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2012-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2012-03-15T00:00:00.000Z"], "title": "2012 - 2012 Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas) English Channel Gillnet Pollack Survey 2011/12 - Fisheries Science Partnership", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "3"}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "51.25"}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "47.5"}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "-7"}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]"}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2018-01-19\"}]"}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "notPlanned"}, {"key": "guid", "value": "CEFASf8d952bd-c11f-4d20-b156-a40b6b830e43"}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2018-01-19T15:07:58"}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "progress", "value": ""}, {"key": "provider", "value": ""}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "dataset"}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)"}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[3, 47.5], [-7, 47.5], [-7, 51.25], [3, 51.25], [3, 47.5]]]}"}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"}], "resources": [{"cache_last_updated": null, "cache_url": null, "created": "2020-09-16T06:39:40.663318", "description": "Resource locator", "format": "", "hash": "", "id": "690675f5-9fc3-423c-9e42-2c87370ea932", "last_modified": null, "metadata_modified": "2020-09-16T06:39:40.663318", "mimetype": null, "mimetype_inner": null, "name": "", "package_id": "370844ce-3b12-44b6-9d06-2063f4371aad", "position": 0, "resource_locator_function": "order", "resource_locator_protocol": "", "resource_type": null, "size": null, "state": "active", "url": "http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/View/3587/", "url_type": null}], "tags": [], "groups": [], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "631ab21d-2154-4637-aec9-266c0add4c04"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
