Ltd.\n     The survey consisted of diver video transects, in situ habitat observations and diver sediment coring. The purpose of the survey was to inform the EIA associated with the development of the Northern Wharf and Queens Wharf areas of Falmouth Docks and proposed capital dredging. Within the project were three main aims:-\n     - To assess the environmental impact of the proposed expansion of the docks with particular focus on the effect of major dredging of the channel on the benthic habitat and sensitive species. The site lies within the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation (SAC) with one of the primary features of importance being the reef forming calcareous algae (Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides) that form maerl beds.\n     - To assess an area identified as a possible site for the placement of the dredged material. Criteria for this site are:-\n     1. An area with habitats not deemed to be of conservation value.\n     2. An area with habitats that could benefit from the introduced material with particular regard to the promotion of new maerl bed formation.\n     - To revisit a number of previously sampled stations in areas historically subjected to commercial dredging in order to inform the EIA on recovery rates of maerl communities", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
