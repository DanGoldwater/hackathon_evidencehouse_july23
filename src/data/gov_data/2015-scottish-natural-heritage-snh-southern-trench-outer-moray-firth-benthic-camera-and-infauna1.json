The main aim of this survey was to improve understanding of the distribution of benthic habitats within the proposed site, contributing to a programme of refining the distribution of protected features within the pMPA. Fourteen dropdown video stations were surveyed and at a selection of these stations seven grab samples were collected. Further aims of the investigation were to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance and opportunistic/contingency sampling. Seastar Survey Ltd. was contracted by SNH to undertake the infaunal analysis of the grab samples, including identifying all the faunal components within the grab samples, sediment particle size analysis (PSA), and assigning a biotope to each sample. Dr Colin Moore was contracted by SNH to undertake video analysis and assign biotopes to each sample based on the physical and biological attributes.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-1.4107", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.9031", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.3775", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.0385", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "07167014-876a-4571-90e0-cea758e4189a", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"This survey recorded no species or biotope occurences that SNH consider as sensititive; all records may therefore be released in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations of Freedom of Information Regulations; additionally its re-use and dissemination is permissable under Open Government Licence terms.
