The survey area comprises part of the South Devon pilot site for the FCE Interreg project FISH INTEL. Data used to ground truth and document the habitat used by species tracked within the survey area using acoustic telemetry methods during FISH INTEL. At each survey site/station three replicate 45 minute baited underwater video system (BRUV) deployments were made. Sites/stations based on previous survey experience in the area and locations of acoustic receivers. Data will help document habitats (and associated mobile fauna) that focal species of the FISH INTEL project interact with at different temporal and spatial scales and inform if and how these species use these areas, informing future management of these species as well as the implementation and management of protected areas going forward.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
