An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by Heriot-Watt University and SNH for MS between the 3rd and 5th September 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 51 sites within the Noss Head area concentrating immediately in and around the area of historic records of M. modiolus. The images and infaunal samples, analysed under SNH contract by Heriot-Watt University, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. An infaunal grab survey was also undertaken on this survey at a subset of 10 drop-down video stations, selected to target the range of likely sedimentary habitats as well as the horse mussel bed with the purpose to gain a broader understanding of the habitat type and assist in biotope assignment. The vessel RV Alba na Mara was used for this survey - samples were also collected from the Southern Trench on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
