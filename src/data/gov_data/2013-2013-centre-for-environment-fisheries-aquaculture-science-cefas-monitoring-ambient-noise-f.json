The recorder was deployed on 15 April 2013 and recovered \nwithout incident on 2 June 2013. This gave a total of 48 days of continuous \nrecording whilst underwater. The West Gabbard site was chosen due to its close \nproximity to shipping lanes.\n\nApproximately six weeks of data were collected, on a pseudo continuous scheme. \nThe only gaps in the recordings occurred when the instrument was writing data \nto disk, i.e. approximately 1 minute out of 18 minutes. The recorder produced \n3842 wav files, each containing 17 minutes of usable data (approximately 1,088 \nhours). Each single 17 minute file may contain a large number of events, \nranging from biological sounds to shipping, and is usually dominated by \nmeteorological sounds such as wind, waves and rain.\n\nTotal size of data: 240 Gigabytes.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "2.5", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "52.25", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "51.75", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "2", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-06-17\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS6e8a1cc4-e21e-4e99-abc9-c8a639a62aef", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-06-17T09:19:14", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[2.5, 51.75], [2, 51.75], [2, 52.25], [2.5, 52.25], [2.5, 51.75]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "f07fa7d9-c8da-48a1-ab2d-32a21d45d7fa", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "ad931e33-40bf-47fb-8ffd-9b555fb59874"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
