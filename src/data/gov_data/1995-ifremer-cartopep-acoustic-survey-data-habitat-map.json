Multibeam bathymetry data processed with the Caraibes software (v3.9) and a 30m grid created.The data was acquired in 1995 when multibeam systems were first emerging onto the commercial market. The number of beams per ping was limited and thus the data density low in comparison to more modern data. Data editting was only done on data that was significantly in error. The multibeam backscatter data was also processed in the Caraibes software package and produced 2 mosaics at 50m resolution. The backscatter data did not have higher resolution data. Correlation with ground truth data, consisting of sediment samples and photographic imagery samples, predominantly toward the top of slope and seamount summit and flanks,allowed basic interpretation of the bathymetry and backscatter data near the sample locations. To aid interpetation, the sediment samples had been divided into FOLK categoriesand habitat type determinations, as well as faunal communities in some instances, had beeen made for the photographic imagery samples.Characterisation was spread over the whole area and divided into polygon regions by finding interpretive boundaries on either backscatter imagery (such as texture changes or contrast changes) or on the bathymetric layers of slope, rugosity and relief.\n\nDerived using acoustic data supplied by Ifremer (FR).\n\nAdditional information source:\n\nSotheran, I., Benson, A. & Crawford-Avis, O., (2014), Mapping habitats and biotopes from acoustic datasets to strengthen the information base of Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Phase 2 (Barra Fan and Hebrides Terrace Seamount Area), JNCC Report 527, ISSN 0963 8901", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"None\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-9.070273", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.063657", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "56.092737", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-10.726934", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2014-06-30\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "aface91c-7dd7-4a6e-9f63-0af60aa0c789", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2018-06-14", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Digital and Data Solutions, JNCC (originator)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-9.070273, 56.092737], [-10.726934, 56.092737], [-10.726934, 57.063657], [-9.070273, 57.063657], [-9.070273, 56.092737]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) is the statutory adviser to the UK Government on national and international nature conservation.
