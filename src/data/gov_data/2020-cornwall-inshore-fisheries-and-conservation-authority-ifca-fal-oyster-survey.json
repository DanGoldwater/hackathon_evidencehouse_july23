The purpose of the survey was initially to assess the distribution and abundance of native oysters (Ostrea edulis) within the Fal Fishery management area in the River Fal, Cornwall. Since 2016 the survey has been developed to also assess queenies (queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis; variegated scallop, Mimachlamys varia) distribution and abundance. In 2018, an addition to the survey was made to record the number of individual slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) at each site.\n     The aims of the survey were to investigate the relative abundance and distribution of native oysters (O. edulis),  scallops (queen scallop, A. opercularis; variegated scallop, M. varia) and slipper limpets (C. fornicata) within the Fal Oyster Fishery. The distribution of substrate types across the fishery were also recorded at each site and species of bycatch were recorded across the survey area as a list of species present. \n     In 2020, a total of 82 sites were completed and a total of 1265 oysters, 4977 scallops and 8753 slipper limpets were recorded. The analysis was done by Management Areas; A, B and C.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
