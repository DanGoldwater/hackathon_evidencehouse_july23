These included both intertidal and\n     subtidal components although monitoring effort was focussed on the subtidal. Detailed biological and physical surveys were conducted; the topography was mapped and the biotopes surveyed by MNCR phase 2 methodology at relocatable points along the cave system.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
