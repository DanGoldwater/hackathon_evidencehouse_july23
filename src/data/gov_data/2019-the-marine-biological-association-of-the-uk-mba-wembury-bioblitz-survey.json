The aim of this survey was to record as many species as possible as being present within a set survey area in Wembury, Devon over 24-hours. A variety of different methods were employed, including times-species searches, plankton netting, Seine-netting, Pond-dipping with nets, mammal trapping, walkovers, push-netting, grab/core, transect/quadrat, and including Dive and snorkel surveys, although most records were ad-hoc sightings made during the 24 hour survey. This was the 11th annual survey run by the MBA. All records were verified by experts and data team staff.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
