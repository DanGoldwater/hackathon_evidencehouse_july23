The aim of this survey was to record as many species as possible as being present within a set survey area in Plymouth, Devon over 24-hours.  A variety of different methods were employed, including times-species searches, plankton netting, Seine-netting, Pond-dipping with nets, mammal trapping, walkovers, push-netting, grab/core, transect/quadrat, and including Dive and snorkel surveys, although most records were ad-hoc sightings made during the 24 hour survey. This was the 8th annual survey run by the MBA. All records were submitted via iRecord (either using the iRecord mobile app by recorders or via the iRecord website project page by the Data Team). All records were verified by experts and data team staff.", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
