A copy of report and complete collection of catalogued slides, bound in a separate volume, are held at Dorset Environmental Records Centre.\n     This survey was carried out by Environment and Resource Technology (ERT) for Amoco. Diving fieldwork took place between 16-25 September 1994, during which 29 stations were sampled in the area bounded by Portland Harbour to the west and Clavel Tower at Kimmeridge to the east. MNCR survey protocols were used, with sampling carried out by diver pairs skilled in in situ fauna and flora identification. Infaunal samples (0.1m sq, 20cm deep and 1.0mm sieved) were obtained at some stations using a Hardy-Barnett suction sampler. Station positions were fixed using a hand-held GPS on the OSGB36 spheroid.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
