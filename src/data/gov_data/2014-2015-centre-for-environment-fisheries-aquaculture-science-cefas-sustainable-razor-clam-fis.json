The aim of the survey was to establish \nwhether a commercial fishery with this gear was viable commercially and \nenvironmentally sustainable.\n\nThere was initially a period of gear design and construction which, together \nwith some unavailability of either the vessel of Cefas staff, delayed the \nproject until the winter of 2013/14. The weather was exceptionally poor and \ndelayed the start of work such that funding had to be carried forward into the \nnext financial year. Fieldwork commenced in May at a site off Southport, but \ndespite the experimental gear deploying and working as envisaged, no razor \nclams were caught.\n\nIt was decided that a new fishing area should be tried and at the suggestion \nof the skipper, a diving company was engaged to survey positions where catches \nhad been made previously. One position was found to have a significant density \nof razor clams and this was chosen as a target for the next trip. \nUnfortunately this position was in too shallow water for *Harmoni * to reach \nand deploying the gear a short distance to seaward produced no catch. After \nfurther tows through the area which also proved barren, the project was \nabandoned.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-3", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "55.5", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "53.25", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-6", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-02-14\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASe64c8df1-96bd-4671-bb33-0caec45b93e2", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2017-02-14T10:27:00", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-3, 53.25], [-6, 53.25], [-6, 55.5], [-3, 55.5], [-3, 53.25]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "805bbedf-5310-4995-be3f-1a831aee8f4b", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "1e1069ec-adaa-4452-a002-af1732692dfc"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
