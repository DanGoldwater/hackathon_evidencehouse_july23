SCM was inaugurated at this site in 2004, which provided a baseline for the current study. The principle aims were to: (1) identify any deterioration in the condition of the mudflat feature; and (2) to form a judgement on its current condition. The approach taken to achieve this aim was to resurvey two representative, relocatable transects established in 2004.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
