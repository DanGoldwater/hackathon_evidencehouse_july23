This survey took place over three days in July 2016. The purpose of this monitoring survey was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats - sandflats are a protected feature of this site and component habitats include intertidal seagrass beds and blue mussel beds (both of which are PMFs).
