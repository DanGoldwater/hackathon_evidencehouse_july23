In addition, the data should also allow judgement to be made as to the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to establish a series of 16 relocatable stations along 5 transects, representing identifiable zones that reflect the biological and environmental diversity of the sediment flats in the SSSI.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
