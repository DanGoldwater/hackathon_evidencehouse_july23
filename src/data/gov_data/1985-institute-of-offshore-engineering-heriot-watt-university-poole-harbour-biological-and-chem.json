A copy of the report is held at English Nature (Dorset Team). \n     This report presents the results of an environmental survey of the intertidal zone in Poole Harbour. Field work was conducted in June 1985 by the Institute of Offshore Engineering (Heriot-Watt University), prior to oil extraction developments by BP on Furzey Island. Fifteen intertidal transects were sampled at high, mid and low tide levels for chemical, biological and particle size analyses. Only biological details have been extracted for this database. Plastic cores of 10cm diameter were used for benthic macrofauna samples. Six replicate cores per station were collected, totalling a sample area of approx. 0.05m2. The species list records all species retained in a 0.5mm sieve. Megafaunal counts were not made due to insufficient time in the field. Positioning: Lat/Long values with accompanying compass bearings to prominent landmarks are listed, but no reference as to how to Lat/Longs were derived i.e. GPS/Chart. Biotopes have been tentatively assigned on entry into this database based on the sediment data displayed in Figure 3 of the report.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
