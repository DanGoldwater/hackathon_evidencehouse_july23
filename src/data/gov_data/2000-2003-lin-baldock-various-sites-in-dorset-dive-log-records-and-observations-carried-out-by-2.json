Event reference for dives refers to the Dive Code in Lin Baldock's dive log which is held by her.  References for intertidal records refer to dates in field notebook.  The thoroughness of the species lists varies depending on other activities being carried out during the dives.  Particular attention was given to algae in most situations.  Identification was mostly carried out in situ.  However, some smaller species (e.g. filamentous algae, caprellids, small bryozoans and hydroids) were identified using a microscope in the laboratory.  If this was the case it is indicated in the \"species qualifier\" box as \"LAB ID\".\n     Notes.\n     The species pair Aglaothamnion byssoides and Aglaothamnion pseudobyssoides has been recorded throughout as Aglaothamnion pseudobyssoides, hence these records may include both species and ID is marked as uncertain.  The two species are difficult to distinguish in the absence of sexual reproductive structures. Species not included in the Species Directory \"Dictionary\" have been included in the description for the relevant event.\n     Field data and specimens are held by Lin Baldock who retains copyright.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
