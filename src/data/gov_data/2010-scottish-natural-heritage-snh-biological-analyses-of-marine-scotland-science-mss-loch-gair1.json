The survey was designed to test gear during a MSS cruise and to collect some potentially useful data at the same time. Still photographs were taken at intervals along runs located within 7 areas in Loch Gairloch.  Video was also collected along some of the runs, although it has not been analysed. The still photographs were taken by MSS between the 3rd and 8th March 2010 on board the vessel FRV Alba na Mara.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
