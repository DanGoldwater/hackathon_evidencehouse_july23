This survey technique was developed initially to assess the reef on Heysham Flat as a tool to investigate the percentage cover and health of Sabellaria aveolata reef, to provide datasets to inform mussel management and to provide data to Morecambe Bay EMS Management Group on condition of the reef. This reef was surveyed annually from 2011-15. In addition this survey was used in other areas, particularly at Dubmill Point in Cumbria. The surveys recorded the percentage cover of S. alveolata as well as other ground cover types and classified the form and health of the growth.\n     Evidence from the annuals surveys showed that there was continuous competition for space on the cobble and boulder reef between substantial mussel settlements and the worms, both of which proved to be ephemeral in nature. This competition was found to be the main driving force behind the health and distribution of the Sabellaria alveolata. Observations continue to be made on this relationship during regular mussel inspections carried out for fisheries management purposes.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
