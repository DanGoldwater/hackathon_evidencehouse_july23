Sampling was undertaken at the Loch Fyne and Loch Goil Nature Conservation MPA because they support a wide range of protected features, including those with a 'Recover' conservation objective. Replicate core samples were collected by divers along five 25m transects using a standard diver core. 28 infaunal samples were collected on this survey, but no PSA samples were taken. The position of each  transect and sample replicate station were recorded. In addition to the collection of infaunal samples, divers assessed the extent of the flame shell bed and permanent transects were established in five locations to enable relocation of the stations. Precision Marine Survey Ltd. were commissioned by SNH to undertake faunal analysis of the samples. Laboratory processing methodologies were based on best practice and followed NMBAQC guidelines.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.3685", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "56.0101", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "56.0011", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.3813", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "7a2fb0c2-76b7-4a6c-a9fa-dc63907338de", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"This survey recorded no species or biotope occurences that SNH consider as sensititive; all records may therefore be released in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations or Freedom of Information Regulations; additionally its re-use and dissemination is permissable under Open Government Licence terms.
