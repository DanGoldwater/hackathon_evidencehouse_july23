Beyond the 30m depth contour was of particular interest and identification of the distribution of the feature 'Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time'. Dropdown video drifts were undertaken at 30 stations. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. Runs traversing a sequence of habitats were split into corresponding segments. Species present were, as far as possible, identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale and biotopes were allocated based on the physical and biological attributes.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-3.2870", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "58.0810", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.6280", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.9610", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2016-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "8f3ed2b0-d977-4ebb-8e12-8c2afec978a5", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
