An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by MSS for MSS between the 31st October 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 11 sites in the area. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel MRV Scotia for this survey - footage was collected from around Fetlar and south-west of Scalloway on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
