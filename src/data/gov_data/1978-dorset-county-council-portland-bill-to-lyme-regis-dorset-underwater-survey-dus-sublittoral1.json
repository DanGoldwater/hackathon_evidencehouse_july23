This survey recorded the wildlife in the underwater areas between Portland Bill and Lyme Regis and concentrated on the mapping of associations and their habitats. A diving team surveyed 35 sublittoral sites between 17.8.1978 and 15.9.1978.  An additional 5 sites were surveyed in the littoral zone. The seaward extent of the survey area was variable but reached a maximum of 2.5km from the coast near Seatown.
