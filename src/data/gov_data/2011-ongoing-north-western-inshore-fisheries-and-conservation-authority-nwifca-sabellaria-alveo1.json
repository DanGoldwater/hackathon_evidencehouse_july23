This reef is surveyed annually. In addition this survey has been used in other areas, particularly at Dubmill point in Cumbria. \n     The survey records the percentage cover of S. alveolata as well as other ground cover types and classifies the form and health of the growth.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-3.1960", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "54.0437", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "54.0346", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.2116", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"revision\", \"value\": \"2013-12-12\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "annually", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "80c58add-5292-4a70-aadf-a3086782ceb1", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.
