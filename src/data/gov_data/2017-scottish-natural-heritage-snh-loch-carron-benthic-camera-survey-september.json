The survey built on three previous surveys of the Loch Carron MPA and adjacent waters in 2017 to further refine the distribution of key PMF habitats and condition of the recently identified flame shell beds to the North and West of Sgeir Bhuidhe. A total of 117 sites distributed throughout the MPA were surveyed. Further south of the MPA, 23 sites were surveyed between An Dubh-aird and Loch Alsh.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
