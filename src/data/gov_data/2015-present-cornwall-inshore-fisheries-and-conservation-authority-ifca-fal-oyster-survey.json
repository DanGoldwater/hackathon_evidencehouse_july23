The purpose of the survey was initially to assess the distribution and abundance of native oysters (Ostrea edulis) within the Fal Fishery management area in the River Fal, Cornwall. Since 2016 the survey has been developed to also assess queenies (queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis; variegated scallop, Mimachlamys varia) distribution and abundance. Slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) were initially recorded at each site using a SACFOR style scheme which was amended in 2018 to a count for this species. \n     The aims of the survey were to investigate the relative abundance and distribution of native oysters (O. edulis), scallops (queen scallop, A. opercularis; variegated scallop, M. varia) and slipper limpets (C. fornicata) within the Fal Oyster Fishery. The distribution of substrate types across the fishery and species of bycatch were also recorded at each site in 2019.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
