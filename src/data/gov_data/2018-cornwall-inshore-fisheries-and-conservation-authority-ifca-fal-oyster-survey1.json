The purpose of the survey was initially to assess the distribution and abundance of native oysters (Ostrea edulis) within the Fal Fishery management area in the River Fal, Cornwall. Since 2016 the survey has been developed to also assess queenies (queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis; variegated scallop, Mimachlamys varia) distribution and abundance. In 2018, an addition to the survey was made to record the number of individual slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) at each site instead of the subjective broad approach of a SACFOR style recording system which was used prior to this.\n     The aims of the survey were to investigate the relative abundance and distribution of native oysters, O. edulis,  scallops (queen scallop, A. opercularis; variegated scallop, M. varia) and slipper limpets (C. fornicata) within the Fal Oyster Fishery. The distribution of substrate types across the fishery and species of bycatch were also recorded at each site. \n     In 2018, a total of 83 sites were completed and a total of 1501 oysters, 4145 scallops and 11525 slipper limpets were recorded. The analysis was done by sections; Harbour, Outer Harbour and River.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
