A copy of the report is held at BP Exploration Operating Company Ltd, Wareham, Dorset.\n     This survey was carried out by Fawley Aquatic Research Laboratories Ltd for BP Exploration Operating Company Ltd in December 2001. It forms part of a continuing study of the effects of the discharge from a hydroclone situated on Furzey Island jetty. This report gives the findings of the third post-commissioning survey. Three replicate van Veen grab samples (0.1m2) were taken at each site. Faunal samples were preserved and taken back to the lab for identification. \n     As far as practicable, the sampling stations were those as used in the previous surveys (1995, 1998, 1999, 2001). Station position fixing was by GPS and by reference to landmarks.
