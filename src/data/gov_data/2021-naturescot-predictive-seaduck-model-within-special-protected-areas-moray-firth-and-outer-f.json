Seven of these sites include one or more species of inshore wintering waterfowl (divers, grebes, seaduck) as qualifying features. Marine Protected Areas, including SPAs, contribute towards achieving Favourable Conservation Status of vulnerable species and habitats across the Atlantic Biogeographic Region. Seaducks feed upon a range of prey, some of which have specific benthic habitat requirements and/or form biogenic habitat features. In order to meet specific Conservation Objectives, site management requires an understanding of the distribution and extent of relevant prey and associated supporting habitats within individual SPAs. NatureScot commissioned this project to test and evaluate the use of predictive modelling and mapping approaches to identify prey-supporting habitats for wintering seaducks within the Moray Firth and the Outer Firth of Forth and St Andrews Bay Complex (OFFSABC) marine SPAs. The project resources include: Project report, supplementary technical report, two html maps for SPA species sample coverage and SPA biotope sample coverage, and a CSV file showing associations between species and biotopes. Predictive model outputs have been produced by mapping the known and predicted distributions and extents of bivalve and gastropod prey, and associated supporting seabed habitats for wintering seaducks within the two marine SPA's.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
