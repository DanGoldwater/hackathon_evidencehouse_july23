The aims of this study, commissioned by the South-West Region of English Nature, are to assess the ecological status of the northern shores of Poole Harbour in terms of the invertebrate infauna, with particular emphasis on the larger species used for fishing bait. Nine shore locations were selected for detailed evaluation, 7 within the north-east sector of the Harbour, and 2 to the north-west. The shores selected represented a range of sedimentary types and all experience significant levels of bait digging. Box core samples of 0.05 m sq were taken at a range of levels at 50m intervals along a downshore transect at each site. Two randomly located samples were taken at each site (0.05m sq box core was pushed into the sediment to a depth of 0.15m), this was sieved through a 1mm mesh. Infaunal samples were identified in the lab. All species densities are expressed as numbers per metre sq of shore.
