An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 8th and 9th February 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 14 sites within an area of the sound that is at the time of sampling was being proposed as a location for a tidal energy test facility. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. SNH used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
