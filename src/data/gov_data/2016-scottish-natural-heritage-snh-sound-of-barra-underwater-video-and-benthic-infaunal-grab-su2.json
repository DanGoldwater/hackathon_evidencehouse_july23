This was targeted to 9 sampling boxes located within and outside the eastern side of the Sound of Barra SAC. Digital still photographs were taken at intervals of the video survey to enable description of seabed structure and species assemblages. The main aims of this investigation were to: (1) improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognized conservation importance (in particular, refining the distribution of Habitats Directive Annex 1 habitats); (2) determine the current condition of the maerl and coarse sediment habitats on the eastern side of the Sound of Barra SAC; and (3) contribute towards site condition monitoring of the SAC.
