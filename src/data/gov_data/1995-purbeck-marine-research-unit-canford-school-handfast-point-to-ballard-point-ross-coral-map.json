A copy of the report is held at English Nature (Dorset Team).\n     Following on from the survey work carried out in 1994, thirteen survey dives were undertaken in 1995 to provide further information on the extent of the Ross Coral colonies between Handfast Point and Ballard Point. Drift dives were used to make transects of the area. GPS/Decca navigation on the charter vessel Sea Ranger was used to pinpoint the position of divers at the start, during and at the end of the dive (following the diver's Surface Marker Buoy). The majority of dives were made at a working depth of 15-20m. Ross coral was found to be in the greatest abundance at 50'37.90N  01'55.00W. The largest colonies seen (50cm diameter) were in the area of more extensive chalk outcrops and ridges. The cobbles, small boulder and chalk ridges, that provide the most suitable substrate for attachment, change to gravel and sand, both unsuitable for the attachment of Ross coral, to the north (Poole Bay) and to the south (Swanage Bay) of the main survey area. The deeper water (>20m) to the west of the survey area has not yet been explored but its likely that Ross coral should occur if there is suitable substrate. Underwater photography was used extensively.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
