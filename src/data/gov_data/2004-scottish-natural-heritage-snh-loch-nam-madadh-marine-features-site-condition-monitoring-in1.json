This survey was done to: (1) establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the habitats in the future; and (2) to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The main approach taken to achieve these objectives was to perform a drop-down video survey of the biotopes of the SAC, concentrating on the sublittoral sediments, to characterise the infauna of the main sediment biotopes by means of grab and core sampling, and to perform surveys of the epibiota of rock, lagoon, maerl and Zostera biotopes along relocatable transects.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"no restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-7.0745", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.6715", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.5877", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-7.2517", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2006-01-01\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "afccda45-aa08-4a0b-8283-d930efd0df0f", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not suitable for use in navigation; SNH copyright data which is available for re-use under government licence terms: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2019-08-07", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": " (originator); Scottish Natural Heritage, Inverness (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-7.0745, 57.5877], [-7.2517, 57.5877], [-7.2517, 57.6715], [-7.0745, 57.6715], [-7.0745, 57.5877]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
