It is one of 17 Cefas data \nsources assembled. The Lowestoft Sample Data Management System (LSDM) was the \ntool used for tracking the ingestion, processing and analysis of marine water, \nsediment and radiological samples. It was replaced by the Cefas Laboratory \nInformation Management System (LIMS) in 2015. This dataset is an extract from \nthe LSDM for seawater temperature data (other data are in LIMS and the Cefas \nData Hub). The Laboratory Sample Data Management system (LSDM) was the primary \nsystem used by Cefas (Lowestoft) before and throughout the 1990s (initially \nknown as the Liquid Sample Data Management system). Its function was to \nprovide a vehicle for the management of the ingestion, analysis and recording \nof measurements on marine samples, ranging from oceanographic water samples \nthrough sediments to \u201cenvironmental materials\u201d and radiological samples (see \nSutton (1993) for an example of the supporting role of LSDM in relation to \nthe, usually high level, scientific measurement systems of the day, Sauer et \nal (2002) for an example of its pivotal role in quality assured processes and \nanalyses. As the work profile for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and \nFood Directorate of Fisheries Research changed, followed by the creation of \nCefas and then Defra, the need for the centralised system for the management \nof an extensive suite of physical samples decreased. LSDM was closed down in \n2015 with chemical data transferred to other systems. The temperature data \nheld included the historical ferry routes and historical CTN data. The \nremainder, from a variety of programmes and cruises, are presented in this \nsection.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "20", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "70", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "40", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-50", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-09-16\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS73a6f865-60c6-470f-a2df-b2ff623600fc", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-09-16T13:13:58", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[20, 40], [-50, 40], [-50, 70], [20, 70], [20, 40]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "e531ceee-2f08-408e-893c-1dff6956655f", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "071638a1-72d2-42d5-809e-0f3a89d69d1e"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
