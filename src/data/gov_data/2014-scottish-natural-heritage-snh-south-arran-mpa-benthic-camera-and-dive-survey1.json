An underwater video and a dive survey were conducted between the 15th and 26th September 2015 to collect detailed biological information on three of the MPAs protected features: 'maerl beds', 'kelp and seaweed communities on sublittoral sediment' and 'seagrass beds'. MNCR phase ll style dive surveys were conducted at 6 sites within the South Arran MPA and drop-down video tows were undertaken along 177 transects within 6 search areas of the MPA.
