The stack of tiff images in each 3D dataset show either cuboid, rod and disc/plate like particles as well as irregular shapes and mixtures of these. The data were used to measure packing geometries, contact areas, and pore volumes, surface areas and connectivity, and perform permeability simulation used to develop advanced porosity-permeability relationships for any bead packing geometry. The data were collected on a Nikon XCT scanner with the exact imaging condition for each scan presented in the txt settings file in each folder (including x-ray energy, flux and resolution information). The data may be of use to those developing advanced finite element, discrete element or flow models in complex packed beds.", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 1, "organization": {"id": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "name": "british-geological-survey", "title": "British Geological Survey (BGS)", "type": "organization", "description": "A world-leading geoscience centre for survey and monitoring; modelling and research; data and knowledge.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/home.html\r\n\r\n", "image_url": "2020-08-17-104120.024946BGS-Logo-Pos-RGB-01.png", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:32.295517", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": [], "temporal_coverage-to": [], "title": "3D X-ray tomography scans of analogues for magmatic mushes with different particle geometries (NERC Grant NE/M018687/2)", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"The copyright of materials derived from the British Geological Survey's work is vested in the Natural Environment Research Council [NERC].
