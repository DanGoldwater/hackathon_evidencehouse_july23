The aims of which were to assess the state of herring ( \n*Clupea harengus* ) stocks through measurements of length samples and by \nageing a stratified selection of fish. The latter was also to determine the \nstock split between North Sea and Thames fish as there is a great deal of \nmixing of stocks in the area. Stock identification was done by a combination \nof first year growth observed in the otolith and the maturity stage of the \nfish.\n\nSurvey took place between 17/11/2001 and 30/11/2001 on INA K\n\nEquipment used during this survey :\n\n\n-   Larson Sprat Trawl\n\nSurvey operations were undertaken on 36 stations\n\n8 different species were caught on this survey\n\n\n\n", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "type": "organization", "description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "image_url": "", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2001-11-17T00:00:00.000Z"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2001-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"], "title": "2001 - 2001 Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Survey : INA K 2/01 (part of Blackwater Herring Survey (FSS: INA K HER))", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "2"}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "52"}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "51.25"}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "0"}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]"}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2016-11-02\"}]"}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "notPlanned"}, {"key": "guid", "value": "CEFAS650C16AE-B5C6-47A9-A72E-2FB7C0102A0B"}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2016-11-02T14:06:19"}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "progress", "value": ""}, {"key": "provider", "value": ""}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "series"}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)"}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[2, 51.25], [0, 51.25], [0, 52], [2, 52], [2, 51.25]]]}"}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"}], "resources": [{"cache_last_updated": null, "cache_url": null, "created": "2020-09-16T06:58:56.575669", "description": "Resource locator", "format": "", "hash": "", "id": "d2609e4d-0959-478e-8f24-e3a4d89244ab", "last_modified": null, "metadata_modified": "2020-09-16T06:58:56.575669", "mimetype": null, "mimetype_inner": null, "name": "", "package_id": "24b7f6a3-3db9-41c7-b75c-afeb1c4d77f6", "position": 0, "resource_locator_function": "order", "resource_locator_protocol": "", "resource_type": null, "size": null, "state": "active", "url": "http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/View/10091/", "url_type": null}], "tags": [], "groups": [], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "a2b090a6-f877-4d40-ae83-581e401f9d25"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
