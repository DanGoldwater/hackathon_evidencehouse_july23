This was done to establish a baseline biological dataset that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the inshore sublittoral sediment habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these aims was to perform an extensive dropdown video survey of the biotopes (habitats and their associated species) of the cSAC, concentrating on the shallow inshore sediments. Characterisation of the subsurface fauna and sediment composition of the main sediment biotopes was performed by means of grab sampling. Detailed surveying of the sea bed and subsurface communities at selected maerl sites was carried out using diving techniques.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
