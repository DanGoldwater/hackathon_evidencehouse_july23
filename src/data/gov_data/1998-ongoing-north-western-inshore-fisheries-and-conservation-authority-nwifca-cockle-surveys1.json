Data is collected on the density of cockles in an area, their status in relation to minimum landing size (20 mm) and age. Samples are also often taken for weighing and production of length frequency tables. This data can be used to estimate other parameters such as the mass of stock on the bed. In the past beds have been surveyed regularly (every year). However, the NWIFCA has moved toward a more adaptive survey strategy where beds are more often surveyed after reports of a possible commercial stock by local area officers.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.7356", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "55.0091", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "53.3046", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.7354", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-09-27\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "irregular", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "d7ed6297-7585-45ae-8082-1fd23f9005e0", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.
