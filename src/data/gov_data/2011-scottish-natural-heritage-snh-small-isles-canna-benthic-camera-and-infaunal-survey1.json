An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by SNH for SNH between the 17th and 20th June 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 75 sites in the area. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. An infaunal grab survey was also undertaken on this survey on the 19th and 20th June 2011 at 21 sites to validate the continued presence of PMFs and to supplement existing records in the Sound of Canna. SNH contracted Seastar Survey Ltd to undertake infaunal analysis of the grab samples. SNH used the SEPA vessel SV Sir John Murray for this survey - video footage was collected from the Sound of Sleat, Loch Hourn and Loch Nevis on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
