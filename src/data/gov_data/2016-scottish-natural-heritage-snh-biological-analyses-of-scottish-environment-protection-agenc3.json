Dropdown video drifts at 20 stations where used to achieve this, using SEPAs vessel SV Sir John Murray. Further aims of this survey were to monitor the impacts of human activities and undertake inventory sampling to fill 'gaps' in current understanding. This survey contributes to ongoing monitoring of pressures in the Loch by SEPA. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.6788", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "56.7255", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "56.6474", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.8995", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "b4fd8529-b8dd-4b5b-b58b-6d0d26b96017", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"This survey recorded no species or biotope occurences that SNH consider as sensititive; all records may therefore be released in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations of Freedom of Information Regulations; additionally its re-use and dissemination is permissable under Open Government Licence terms.
