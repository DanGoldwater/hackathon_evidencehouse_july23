The survey was undertaken by SNH and Marine Scotland Science (MSS) on board the MRV Alba na Mara (cruise 1414A) on the 15th and 16th August 2014.  A drop-down video survey of benthic habitats was undertaken at 21 sites within the MPA. Analysis of seabed video and still photographic imagery is used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. This survey was part of a two week research cruise undertaking work in the MPAs Wester Ross, Fetlar to Haroldswick, Mousa to Boddam and Noss Head collecting drop-down video footage, grab samples and sandeel dredge tows.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
