An underwater  photography survey was conducted by MSS for MSS on the 14th September 2013 to collect biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Still photographs were taken along transects at 16 sites within the Carn Skerries area, that at the time of sampling was being proposed as a location for a possible Marine Protected Area (pMPA). Video was not taken on this survey. Analyses on the seabed still images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.
