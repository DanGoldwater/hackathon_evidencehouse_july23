An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by MSS for MSS on the 2nd November 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 9 sites within the loch. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel MRV Alba na Mara for this survey - footage was collected from East Shiant Bank and the Little Minch on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
