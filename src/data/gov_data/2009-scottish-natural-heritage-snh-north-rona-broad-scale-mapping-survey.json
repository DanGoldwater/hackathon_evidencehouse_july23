The survey area encompasses the seabed all around North Rona. BSM was conducted in two phases: 1) an acoustic survey; 2) a ground-truthing survey through camera deployments (video and still photography). The aim of the acoustic element of the survey was to identify different backscatter returns and describe, as well as delineate, the extent of the various seabed habitat types occurring around North Rona. A digital sidescan sonar mosaic, in conjunction with single beam echo sounder derived bathymetry, provided the initial broadview to map the substrata present throughout the survey area as well as allowing the identification of any features of interest. The aim of the ground-truthing element of the survey was to provide a description of the richness and diversity of the habitats on both rocky reef and the softer sediments. The biotope distribution and species composition was developed through interpretation of dropdown video footage and digital still photography, taken after evaluation of the sidescan mosaic. All survey operations were conducted by contractors Seastar Survey Ltd from their vessel SV Otarie.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
