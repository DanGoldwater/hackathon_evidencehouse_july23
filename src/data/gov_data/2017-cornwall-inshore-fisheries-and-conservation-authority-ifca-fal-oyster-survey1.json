The purpose of the survey was initially to assess the distribution and abundance of native oysters (Ostrea edulis) within the Fal Fishery management area in the River Fal, Cornwall. Since 2016 the survey has been developed to also assess queenies (queen scallop, Aequipecten opercularis; variegated scallop, Mimachlamys varia) distribution and abundance. Slipper limpets (Crepidula fornicata) were recorded at each site using a SACFOR style scheme. \n     The aims of the survey were to investigate the relative abundance and distribution of native oysters (O. edulis) and scallops (queen scallop, A. opercularis; variegated scallop, M. varia) within the Fal Oyster Fishery. The distribution of substrate types across the fishery were also recorded at each site and species of bycatch were recorded across the survey area as a list of species present. \n     In 2017, a total of 80 sites were completed and a total of 1481 oysters and 2952 scallops were recorded. The analysis was done by Geographic Areas; Harbour, Outer Harbour and River.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
