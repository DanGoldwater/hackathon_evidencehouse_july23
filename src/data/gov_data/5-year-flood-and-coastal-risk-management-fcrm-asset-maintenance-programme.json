This programme is updated every three months to show progress.\n\nThe following four years of the programme show the maintenance needs that we have currently identified that will be considered and prioritised for potential funding as part of our annual Flood Defence Grant in Aid allocation process. The allocation process takes into account the benefits and costs of the work and other factors such as legal obligations. A need shown on the programme for future years does not imply that funding will be available to undertake the work. As new future maintenance needs are identified they will be added to the programme as an annual update.\n\nINFORMATION WARNING\nThe data shows the areas and locations where investment is being made to manage flood and coastal risk. They are not detailed enough to show the impact they may have on individual addresses, which may not always face the same risk of flooding as the areas that surround them.
