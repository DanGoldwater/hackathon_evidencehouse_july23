Copies of the forms are held at the Dorset Environmental Records Centre.\n\nThis was the first co-ordinated subtidal survey off the Dorset coast. The objectives of the survey were to map and describe the dominant subtidal fauna and flora and compile a comprehensive species list of the area around Kimmeridge Bay (Worbarrow Tout - Clavell Tower). Transect lines of obvious land marks were used for rough position fixing. The boat skipper took horizontal sextant fixes at regular intervals during the dive.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
