Video footage and still images were recorded at 9 stations. Through the analysis of seabed video and stills, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. Runs traversing a sequence of habitats were split into corresponding segments. Species present were, as far as possible, identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale and biotopes were allocated based on the physical and biological attributes.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
