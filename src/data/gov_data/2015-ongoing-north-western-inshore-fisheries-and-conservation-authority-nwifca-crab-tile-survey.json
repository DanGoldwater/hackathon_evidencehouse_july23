Crab tiles are small structures that are placed on the foreshore by bait gatherers. These structures provide shelter from crabs and the crabs can be collected from under the tiles at low tide. Crab tiles are usually made out of lengths of guttering or pipe stuck almost vertically into the mud or sand. This survey technique has been developed by Officers to provide an overview of crab tiles in an area and consists primarily of mapping but also interviews with gatherers encountered. The data collected will be used to inform fisheries management decisions and also Habitats Regulations Assessments carried out under the review of fishing activity in European Marine Sites.", "license_title": "", "theme-secondary": [], "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.5776", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "54.9642", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "53.1788", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.6982", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2015-06-02\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "asNeeded", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "140ed6bc885b522d1eed34fe329899d5", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "140ed6bc885b522d1eed34fe329899d5", "key": "harvest_source_reference"}, {"value": "harvest", "key": "import_source"}, {"value": "Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.
