A copy of the report is held at Dorset Environmental Recods Centre.\n     The distribution of live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum) was further mapped in western Poole Bay and discovered off Seacombe. During the course of these surveys, the extent of two other habitats was mapped: biogenic reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) off Swanage and brittlestar (Ophiothrix fragilis) beds off Kimmeridge. The presence of a seagrass (Zostera marina) bed was confirmed in Poole Harbour from enhancing aerial photos.
