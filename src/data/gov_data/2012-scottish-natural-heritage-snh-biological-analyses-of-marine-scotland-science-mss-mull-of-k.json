The installation of tidal energy devices was proposed at the time of this survey. A further aim was to assess the implications of this planned renewable energy development on the features of importance. An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 2nd October 2012 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 4 sites. Analyses on the seabed video and still photographic imagery, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
