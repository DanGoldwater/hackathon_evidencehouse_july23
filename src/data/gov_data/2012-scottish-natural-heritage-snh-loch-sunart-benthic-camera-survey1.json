An underwater video survey were conducted by CEFAS for SNH on the 30-31st August 2012 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 29 sites. Analyses on the seabed video and still photographic imagery, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. CEFAS used the vessel NLV Pole Star for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
