An underwater video survey were conducted by SNH for SNH on the 19th and 20th March 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 27 sites. The images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. SNH used the vessel Sir John Murray for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
