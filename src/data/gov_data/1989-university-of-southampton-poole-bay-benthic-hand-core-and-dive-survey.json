A benthic survey grid of 35 stations was sampled in western Poole Bay. At each site eight 0.006m2 hand cores were collected, one for chemical and sediment analysis and seven replicates for biological analysis. In addition to infaunal studies, the seabed and its associated surface flora and fauna were surveyed to compile a species list for the entire survey area. The sediment analysis revealed that the area was essentially sedimentary with a few outcrops of hard substrate, both natural and anthropogenic. Bottom sediments varied from sand with cobbles to a sandy mud. The infauna was dominated by polychaetes. The dominant epifaunal component was Crepidula fornicata (slipper limpet) beds. A maerl bed was recorded around station G3. Each station was located with AP DYN IV DECCA equipment. A local correction factor was used to reduce the position error to a theoretical 25-50m. Photographs and specimens were taken. The original photographs are held by Department of Oceanography, Southampton University, with a set of copies available from Wytch Farm. In addition to the sediment coring, loose particulate material was tested to detect levels of heavy metals - NB sediment details are not held on this database. Of the 35 stations visited 7 had sediment too compact to allow a sufficient number of replicates for biological analysis. These stations were: B2, C2, D1, E1, E6, E7 and G3.", "license_title": "", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-1.8400", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6950", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.6490", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-1.9300", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-01-25\"}, {\"type\": \"creation\", \"value\": \"1988-07-31\"}, {\"type\": \"revision\", \"value\": \"2013-01-25\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "8a8ce6568e0c492b3179ba1fbc4b5196", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2021-03-25", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Southampton (originator); Natural England (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-1.8400, 50.6490], [-1.9300, 50.6490], [-1.9300, 50.6950], [-1.8400, 50.6950], [-1.8400, 50.6490]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
