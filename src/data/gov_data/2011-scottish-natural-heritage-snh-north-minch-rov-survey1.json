An ROV survey was conducted by the National Oceanographic Centre (NOC) for SNH on the 20th May 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. ROV runs were undertaken at 3 sites. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
