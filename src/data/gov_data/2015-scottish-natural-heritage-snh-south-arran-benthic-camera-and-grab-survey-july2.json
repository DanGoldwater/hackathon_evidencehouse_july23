The primary aim of the grab survey was to establish current baseline conditions for a range of features present within the site, against which future change can be determined. 36 grab samples were collected at 4 sites within the South Arran MPA during this survey period (15-19th). Faunal identification and sediment particle size analysis (PSA) of the grab samples was undertaken and biotopes assigned to each sample by Precision Marine Survey Ltd, contracted by SNH.
