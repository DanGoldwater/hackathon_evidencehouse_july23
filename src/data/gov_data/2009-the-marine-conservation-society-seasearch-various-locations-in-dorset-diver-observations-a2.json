Chartered boats were used for weekend events from Weymouth and Poole between the months of May and September. Club and individual dives have also added to Dorset Seasearch, as have the records from Seasearch training dives and specialist courses. \n     Data from mapping sources have been used to identify sites to dive for the weekend Dorset Wildlife Trust charters. The focus of these surveys were BAP habitats and species as well as ground truthing the acoustic seabed maps. Data from these DWT events was often combined to produce one or two detailed surveyor forms, as opposed to multiple records for the same site.\n     Photographs were taken on all Dorset Wildlife Trust charter weekends and are held by DWT in Dorchester. \n     Records are verified post survey and biotopes are assigned according the information available by DWT using the MNCR 04.05 key.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
