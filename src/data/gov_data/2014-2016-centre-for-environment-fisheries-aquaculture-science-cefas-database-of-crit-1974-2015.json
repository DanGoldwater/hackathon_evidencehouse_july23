The database incorporates 331 measurements of Pcrit from a total \nof 96 published studies and covers 151 fish species from 58 families. It \nprovided the opportunity to critically examine methodologies for determining \nPcrit as well as its usefulness as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance in fish. \nAdditional data are included (when available) on various abiotic and biotic \ninteractions with hypoxia and their effect on Pcrit. These included: water \ntemperature, salinity, pH, carbon dioxide, sex, photoperiod, diet, ration \nsize, body size (mass and length), respirometry method. The aim was to provide \na widely accessible central repository of physiological trait data that will \nfacilitate future studies of fish ecology, conservation and management.\n\n\n\n", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "type": "organization", "description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "image_url": "", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2016-01-30T00:00:00.000Z"], "title": "2014 - 2016 Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Database of critical oxygen level (Pcrit) in freshwater and marine fishes 1974 - 2015", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "1.74086"}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "52.4595"}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "52.4581"}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "1.73881"}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]"}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2021-03-31\"}]"}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "notPlanned"}, {"key": "guid", "value": "CEFASc9a84dbd-48f5-400f-a743-00b8f452a2c8"}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2021-03-31T14:14:48"}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "progress", "value": ""}, {"key": "provider", "value": ""}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "dataset"}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)"}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[1.74086, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4581]]]}"}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4030"}], "resources": [], "tags": [], "groups": [], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "8e26dce6-46f7-4c22-aa4c-9a59d6accdb3"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
