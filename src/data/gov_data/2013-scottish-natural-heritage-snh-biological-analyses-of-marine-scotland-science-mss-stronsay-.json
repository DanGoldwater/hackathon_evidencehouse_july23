An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 8th and 9th February 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 14 sites within an area of the sound that is at the time of sampling was being proposed as a location for a tidal energy test facility. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.
