Quantitative drop-down camera sampling undertaken at 9 stations was used to collect this data. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of PMFs, as well as for the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. Spot dives were also undertaken on this survey at 18 locations. This data is yet to be analysed and reported.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
