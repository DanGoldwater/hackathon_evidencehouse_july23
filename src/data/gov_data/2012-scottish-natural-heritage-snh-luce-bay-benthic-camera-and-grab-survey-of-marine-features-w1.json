A drop-down video survey at 138 locations was undertaken in stages between 10th July and 10th September 2012, to investigate benthic habitats, together with a foot based intertidal survey on 4th August 2012 to map the extent of Sabellaria alveolata reefs. Areas where existing evidence suggested the presence of Modiolus and maerl communities were also investigated. Sampling was also undertaken across the site where no previous seabed data has previously been acquired to enhance the existing knowledge base. A benthic grab survey was undertaken on 9th \u00e2\u0080\u0093 10th June 2013 at 16 stations to determine the biotopes of some of the soft sediment areas identified during the drop down camera survey. This survey work in 2012 and 2013 was undertaken by Seastar Survey Ltd, contracted by SNH, from Seastar Survey's own vessel SV Otarie (drop-video) and from a local fishing vessel (grab).", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
