The report includes survey work documented in previous reports by the same author. However, to avoid duplication, only the survey work undertaken since January 2002 (when the previous report was published) has been entered here. A copy of the report is held at Dorset Environmental Recods Centre.\n     The distribution of live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum) was further mapped in western Poole Bay and discovered off Seacombe. During the course of these surveys, the extent of two other habitats was mapped: biogenic reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) off Swanage and brittlestar (Ophiothrix fragilis) beds off Kimmeridge. The presence of a seagrass (Zostera marina) bed was confirmed in Poole Harbour from enhancing aerial photos. Please note, these records have also been incorporated into subsequent reports written by the same author. \n     The survey data entered into this database has been supplied electronically by Dr. Ken Collins.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
