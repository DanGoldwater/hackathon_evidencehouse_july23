Dropdown video drifts were undertaken at 35 stations. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance; in particular maerl bed and flameshell bed. Runs traversing a sequence of habitats were split into corresponding segments. Species present were, as far as possible, identified and quantified using the semi-quantitative MNCR SACFOR scale and biotopes were allocated based on the physical and biological attributes.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Restrictions on public access due to sensitive species recorded, only available at 20km by 20km resolution\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.1132", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.9351", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.8572", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.5194", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "a1e24fc8-5b3a-4fd4-a3c5-3c1abd5c7995", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
