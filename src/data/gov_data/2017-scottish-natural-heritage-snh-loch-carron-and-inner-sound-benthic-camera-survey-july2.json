The survey was carried out from the vessel FV Shearwater throughout the Loch Carron urgent MPA (May 2017 designation boundary) and extended beyond the south-western boundary to encompass an area of maerl and historic seagrass bed records in Port Luinge, west of Plockton.  Eight drop-down video sites were located in the Inner Sound to the north of Loch Carron in order to confirm the presence of a previously unreported flame shell bed there.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
