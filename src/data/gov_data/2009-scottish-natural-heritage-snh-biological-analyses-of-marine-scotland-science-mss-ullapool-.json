This site was of interest because the area is a dredge spoil ground, located off Ullapool Harbour in the site of a pMPA (status at time of survey). An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 2nd October 2009 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 3 sites. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
