A copy of the report is held at English Nature (Dorset Team) CSD Report 615.\n     This report is based on seven days fieldwork carried out in 1985. The 16 sites sampled were chosen, from previous knowledge, to represent the main substrate types in the area. Distinctive species observed by divers were recorded on site. Less easily identified species were collected and/or photographed for later identification. The report contains comprehensive habitat descriptions, with species associations. The species records input onto the database have been abstracted from the species list in Appendix 1. Positions of survey sites have been estimated from the location map in Appendix 2. Species lists combined in report as sites adjacent with similar substrate.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
