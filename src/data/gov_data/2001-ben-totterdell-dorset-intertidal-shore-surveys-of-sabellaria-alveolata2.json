The project combines on-site surveys, literature searches and personal enquiries. Survey work was undertaken during autumn 2000 and spring 2001, during the 2 hours either side of low water. Shore surveys were made for the entire coastline from the Devon/Dorset border to Seatown, as well as likely sites further east where there were reports of the species being present. Positive records were plotted using GPS and an assessment of their abundance and colony type was made using the SACFORN scale.
