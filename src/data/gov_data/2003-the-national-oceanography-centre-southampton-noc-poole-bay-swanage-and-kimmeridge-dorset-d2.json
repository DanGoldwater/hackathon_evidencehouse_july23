(2003) Dorset marine habitat surveys: Maerl, worm reefs, bream nests, sea fans and brittlestars. 2003 survey results'. A copy of the report is held at Dorset Environmental Records Centre. \n     This report is the third in a series describing marine biodiversity habitats in Dorset surveyed during 2001-3. The report includes survey work documented in previous reports by the same author. However, to avoid duplication, only the survey work undertaken since January 2003 (when the second report was published) has been entered here. \n     The distribution and density of live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum) was resurveyed in western Poole Bay, finding no significant change over the period 2000 - 2003. Two other habitats have been further mapped: biogenic worm reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) off Swanage and brittlestar (Ophiothrix fragilis) beds off Kimmeridge. Bream nests and a specimen of the pink seafan Eunicella verrucosa were discovered whilst investigating a patch reef in Poole Bay and are also reported here. \n     The survey data entered into this database has been supplied electronically by Dr. Ken Collins.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
