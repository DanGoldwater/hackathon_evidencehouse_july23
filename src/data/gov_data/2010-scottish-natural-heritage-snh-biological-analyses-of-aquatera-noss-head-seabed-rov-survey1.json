SNH analysis of the survey data was for the purpose of delineating a Modiolus bed. The overarching aim was to improve knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance, particularly priority marine features (PMFs). An underwater video and was conducted by Triscom Marine for Aquatera Ltd on the 21st and 22nd October 2010 using an ROV to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. ROV runs were undertaken at 10 sites in the area. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
