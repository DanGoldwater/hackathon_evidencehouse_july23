This site was selected for survey as it is a proposed renewable energy location. A drop-down video survey of benthic habitats was undertaken by MSS at 1 site on the 19th July 2014 on board the MSS vessel MRV Alba na Mara (cruise 1214A). SNH analysis of this seabed video and still photographic imagery is used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.5196", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.8031", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.8012", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2.5261", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2015-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "c6e5431a-7ee1-4229-8bf3-981c57026940", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
