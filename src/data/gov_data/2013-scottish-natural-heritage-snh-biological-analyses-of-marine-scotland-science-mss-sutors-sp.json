This site was of interest because the area is a spoil ground located in the mouth of the Cromarty Firth. An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 6th-7th June 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 5 sites. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.
