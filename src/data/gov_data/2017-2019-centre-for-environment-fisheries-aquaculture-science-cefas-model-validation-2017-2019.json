Also, there is a dataset regarding finfish \nfarms modelling.\n\nDifferent types of data have been used for the model set up and observations for the \nmodel validation:\n\nPhysical and biogeochemical observations: data from the Kuwait Environment Public \nAuthority (KEPA) at various monitoring stations for more than 30 years, as part of \nKEPA\u2019s long-term water quality monitoring programme ( `http://www.emisk.org/emisk/`_ \n).

(2014), which was based on \ncompilation of a single beam bathymetry survey conducted in May 2014, by the authors, \nand complemented with digitised sections of a hydrographic chart of the area (Mina Az \nZawr to Al Basrah and Bushehr-UKHO2884) (www.toddchart.com).\n\nTidal forcing: was obtained from the OTPS regional product for the Persian Gulf at \n1/60 degrees resolution ( `http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/PerS.html`_ )\n\nTemperature and Salinity: data from the global ECMWF reanalysis model ORAP5.0, which \ncan be downloaded from \n`http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1`_ \n.\n\nMeteorological forcing: obtained from the European Centre for Medium\u2010Range Weather \nForecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim.\n\n\n\n\n.. _`http://www.emisk.org/emisk/`:\n    http://www.emisk.org/emisk/\n\n.. _`http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/pers.html`:\n    http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/PerS.html\n\n.. _`http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1`:\n    http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/projekte/easy-init/easy-init-ocean.html?no_cache=1\n", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "50", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "52", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "20", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "0.5", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-05-24\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS0aeb2fe3-84aa-4dea-8036-10d2ef10cdab", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-08-14T10:07:17", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[50, 20], [0.5, 20], [0.5, 52], [50, 52], [50, 20]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4030", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "e1cca869-b7d9-4e37-a624-3ddeafdded64", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "0d7a5c2e-2aaf-41dd-af28-7bb47dbff339"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
