This survey recorded the wildlife in the underwater areas between Portland Bill and Lyme Regis and concentrated on the mapping of associations and their habitats. A diving team surveyed 35 sublittoral sites between 17.8.1978 and 15.9.1978.  An additional 5 sites were surveyed in the littoral zone. The seaward extent of the survey area was variable but reached a maximum of 2.5km from the coast near Seatown. Sites from the littoral zone to 18m below chart datum were visited.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
