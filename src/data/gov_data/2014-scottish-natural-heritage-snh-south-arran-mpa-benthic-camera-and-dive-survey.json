An underwater video and a dive survey were conducted between the 15th and 26th September 2015 to collect detailed biological information on three of the MPAs protected features: 'maerl beds', 'kelp and seaweed communities on sublittoral sediment' and 'seagrass beds'. MNCR phase ll style dive surveys were conducted at 6 sites within the South Arran MPA and drop-down video tows were undertaken along 177 transects within 6 search areas of the MPA. SNH used SEPAs survey vessel Kelpie to undertake both surveys.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
