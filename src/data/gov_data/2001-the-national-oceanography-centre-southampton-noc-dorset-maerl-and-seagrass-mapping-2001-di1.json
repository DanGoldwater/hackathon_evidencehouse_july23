The majority of survey work was undertaken in 2001, but the report also draws together additonal survey work on biodiversity habitats from as early as 1998 which had not yet been published. A copy of the report is held at Dorset Environmental Records Centre.\n\nThe report forms part of a continuing study of biodiversity habitats by the author working with volunteer divers. In 2001, the distribution and density of maerl was further mapped in western Poole Bay and for the first time off Kimmeridge. The extent of the seagrass (Zostera marina) has been mapped in Weymouth Bay and along the Poole Harbour entrance Training Bank. During the course of these surveys, further information was found on the extent of two other habitats: biogenic reefs (Sabellaria spinulosa) off Swanage and brittlestar (Ophiothrix fragilis) beds off Kimmeridge. \n\nThe majority of these records were provided electronically by Dr. Ken Collins, a note to clarify where each record was sourced is noted in the description section on the sample screen.
