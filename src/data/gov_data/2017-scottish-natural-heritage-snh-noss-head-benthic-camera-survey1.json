This 1117A survey is part of a series of surveys conducted around the North-east coast of Scotland, at Noss Head, Moray Firth and Southern Trench, to establish the extent of benthic habitats. Quantitative drop-down camera sampling was used to collect this data at 126 stations at Noss Head. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
