M1 was the central station at a historic sludge disposal site in the Central North Sea, approximately 10.5 km away from the English North - East coast, with a depth of 55 m and a muddy sandy sediment. In 1972 and 1973 bimonthly (20 replicates) sampling occurred with sampling decreasing to September and March annually with 5 replicates taken at each occurrence. A 0.1 m2 Van Veen grab was used to collect samples passed over a 0.5 mm sieve and taxon abundance recorded per metre squared (Buchanan and Warwick, 1974). Community stability was seen in the period between 1974 and 1980, which was lost in 1980 - 1983.
