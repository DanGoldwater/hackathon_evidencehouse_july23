An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by Seastar Survey Ltd for SNH between the 4th August and 15th October 2010 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. A range of survey methods were employed, including drop-down video camera operations, sediment grab sampling and scientific diving. The main aim of the survey was to initiate a broad-scale validation survey of historic PMF records (extent, quality and health) and to conduct detailed assessments of discrete features. In addition the survey work aimed to identify new records and achieve a broad coverage of the Clyde Sea area ensuring areas with limited or no data were also surveyed. A total of 129 drop-down video stations, 15 grab samples and 6 dive stations were completed across the Clyde Sea area. All survey operations were conducted from Seastar Survey's own vessel Otarie.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
