Dropdown video drifts were undertaken at 32 stations, largely along the eastern fringe of the Sound.  Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. Grab sampling was also undertaken on this survey at 77 sites.
