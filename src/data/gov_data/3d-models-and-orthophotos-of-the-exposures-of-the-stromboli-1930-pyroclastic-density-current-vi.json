The photographs for the models where taken on 28/7/2021 and were converted to the models and orthophotos using structure for motion photogrammetry and the AGISOFT software. The data was collected to aid grain size analysis, by providing a volume change in the outcrop before and after the collection of a physical sample of the material. The data collection was carried by Dr Irene Manzella, Dr Paul Cole and Symeon Makris.", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 4, "organization": {"id": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "name": "british-geological-survey", "title": "British Geological Survey (BGS)", "type": "organization", "description": "A world-leading geoscience centre for survey and monitoring; modelling and research; data and knowledge.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/home.html\r\n\r\n", "image_url": "2020-08-17-104120.024946BGS-Logo-Pos-RGB-01.png", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:32.295517", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2021-07-26"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2021-09-30"], "title": "3D models and orthophotos of the exposures, of the Stromboli 1930 pyroclastic density current, visited on 28/7/2021 (NERC Grant NE/T009438/1)", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"The copyright of materials derived from the British Geological Survey's work is vested in the Natural Environment Research Council [NERC].
