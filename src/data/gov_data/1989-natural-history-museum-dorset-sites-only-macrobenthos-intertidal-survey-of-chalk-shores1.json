The fauna and flora present on open rock surfaces were recorded by direct observation, particular attention being given to patterns of zonation and biological assemblages. Many species were identified on site, with problematic material being preserved for later determination by specialists at the museum. A quantitative assessment was not made, although general observations on relative abundance were noted. Voucher specimens were collected for each of the species encountered, including algae.\n     N.B. In the report, 11 chalk sites were studied in detail but only 4 of these were in Dorset. Only the 4 Dorset sites have been entered onto the Dorset Marine Biodiversity Database. Species records have been extracted from Table 2 (fauna) and Table 4 (flora) in the main report and then compared to the raw data sheets in the Appendix of the report to give the final species list. Any discrepancies between the two lists have been flagged up in the description section on the sample screen.
