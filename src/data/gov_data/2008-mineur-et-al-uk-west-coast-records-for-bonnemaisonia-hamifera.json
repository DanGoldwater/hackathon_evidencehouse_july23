However, this theory has been the subject of a debate ove rthe last decade, since some studies have shown the opposite trend. In the present study, a macroalgal survey was carried out at 24 localities in Northern Ireland and southern England, using a quadrat approach in the lower littoral. The two opposing hypotheses were tested (negative versus positive relationship between native and non-indigenous species richness) in this marine environment. The effect of the presence of \u00e2\u0080\u0098impacts\u00e2\u0080\u0099, potential sources of disturbance and species introduction(e.g. marina, harbour or aquaculture), was also tested. A positive relationship was found between the number of non-indigenous species and the native species richness at the three different scales tested (quadrats, sites and localities). At no scale did a richer native assemblage appear to restrict the establishment of introduced species. The analyses revealed greater species richness and different community composition, as well as more non-indigenous species, in southern England relative to Northern Ireland. The presence of the considered impacts had an effect on the community composition and species richness in southern England but not in Northern Ireland. Such impacts had no effect on the non-indigenous species richness in either area.", "license_title": "", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"DASSH terms and conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-3.0060", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6868", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "49.8441", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-6.1701", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2008-03-17\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "b8725f50926c1d9d689963de6edb9d55", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"CC BY 4.0\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2021-05-11", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Queen's University Belfast School of Biological Sciences (originator); Data Archive for Seabed Species and Habitats (DASSH) (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-3.0060, 49.8441], [-6.1701, 49.8441], [-6.1701, 50.6868], [-3.0060, 50.6868], [-3.0060, 49.8441]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
