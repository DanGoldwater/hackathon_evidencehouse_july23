The two principle objectives being to gather sufficient data to form judgement on the current condition of the interest features of the sites, and to establish a baseline biological dataset that will facilitate future site condition monitoring surveys of the Papa Stour caves and reefs features. To achieve this goal, the survey methodology included several elements: 1) marking and measurement of reef and cave transects, to facilitate their re-location and the production of near-scale transect diagrams; 2) recording of epibiota to MNCR Phase 2 level within defined re-locatable areas representative of each habitat identified at the transect; 3) production of a video and/or photographic stills record of: a) the extent and distribution of substrata and habitats within the transect, and b) the extent and distribution of epibiota and biotopes within each transect; 4) a remote video survey using a drop-down camera system to record the extent and distribution of substrata, habitats, epibiota and biotopes at survey stations. The outcome of this work was a total of five cave transects (all sublittoral) and ten reef transects (ten littoral and nine sublittoral) surveyed, in addition to which five sublittoral sites were sampled remotely using the drop-down video system.", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "theme-secondary": ["Mapping"], "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"no restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-1.6363", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "60.3570", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "60.2958", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-1.7667", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2005-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "97a88382-af77-4f30-af3e-a9afbe383495", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "97a88382-af77-4f30-af3e-a9afbe383495", "key": "harvest_source_reference"}, {"value": "harvest", "key": "import_source"}, {"value": "Not for navigational use; SNH copyright data which is available for re-use under government licence terms: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2018-02-22", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Scottish Natural Heritage, Inverness (custodian); ERT (Scotland) Ltd (originator)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\":\"Polygon\",\"coordinates\":[[[-1.6363, 60.2958],[-1.6363, 60.3570], [-1.7667, 60.3570], [-1.7667, 60.2958], [-1.6363, 60.2958]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
