A copy of the report is held at Poole Harbour Commissioners, Dorset.\n     This survey was undertaken in 3 phases, the aim being to establish a baseline survey of subtidal species and provide a framework for future monitoring. All the surveys were commissioned by the Nature Conservancy Council. The first survey was of Holes Bay in 1982. This was followed by surveys of the southern sector (1984) and northern sector (1985). All 3 surveys used a combination of grab, dredge and dive transect sampling. Samples were taken at 120 stations across the Harbour using conventional dredge and grab sampling methods. Dive transects were also established at 49 points, covering all sections of the Harbour with species and habitat details recorded metre by metre. For recording purposes, the harbour was divided up into 16 areas for which the species lists of the three survey methods were combined. For entry onto the database, each area has been enclosed within a bounding box from which the SW and NE corners have been used as the area covered by the survey. For more accurate positional information about each survey station, please refer to the original map in the report. For each site, a single species list has been compiled which combines records from all the different survey methods used.", "license_title": "", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-1.9164", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.7360", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.6614", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2.0835", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-02-14\"}, {\"type\": \"creation\", \"value\": \"1985-12-31\"}, {\"type\": \"revision\", \"value\": \"2013-02-14\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "94b416f3b80e78a7739af2d8dc837d13", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2021-03-24", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Poole Harbour Commissioners (custodian); University of Wales Swansea, Natural Sciences (originator); Natural England (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-1.9164, 50.6614], [-2.0835, 50.6614], [-2.0835, 50.7360], [-1.9164, 50.7360], [-1.9164, 50.6614]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
