SmartBuoys consist of a 4 meter tall stainless steel \nframe with a fibreglass torroid for buoyancy. Instruments are attached at a \nnominal 1 meter depth to the frame. In-air sensors are mounted to the top of \nthe torroid. The buoys feature a satellite telemetry system providing near \nreal-time telemetry. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll \nfluorescence, turbidity and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) sensors \nwhere fitted to a Cefas ESM2 data logger. These instruments gathered data for \n5 minutes every 30 minutes. Sensors were validated against in-situ samples \nduring deployment and recovery. The buoy was also fitted with a water sampler \nwhich took periodic samples into pre-spiked (MgCl2) bags for later nutrient \nanalysis. The in-situ salinity and nutrients samples are quality controlled \nvia the Quality Assurance for Marine Environmental Measurements (QUASIMEME) \nscheme. PAR sensors were calibrated against a standard lamp. Fluorometers were \nstandardised using fluorosphere beads. Turbidity meters were calibrated using \nStabical (Hach, US). This mooring was also fitted with a thermistor string \n(multiple temperature sensors at various depth), this data is held by BODC. \nThe data were collected as part of the Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry (SSB) \nresearch programme as part work package 2. SSB was co-funded by the Natural \nEnvironment Research Council (NERC) and the Department for Environment, Food \nand Rural Affairs (Defra). The programme took a holistic approach to the \ncycling of nutrients and carbon and the controls on primary and secondary \nproduction in UK and European shelf seas, to increase understanding of these \nprocesses and their role in wider biogeochemical cycles. This data represents \na snapshot of the wider Celtic Deep 2 SmartBuoy. The Celtic Deep SmartBuoy was \nfirst deployed in 2009 under the Defra E5304 project. From 2014 the mooring \nwas maintained under the SSB project. This mooring was also fitted with a \nthermistor string (multiple temperature sensors at various depth), this data \nis held by BODC.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "1.74086", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "52.4595", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "52.4581", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "1.73881", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-09-16\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASc7fa9f9d-5320-4777-a978-fd6ae9673a7e", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-09-16T13:40:34", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[1.74086, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4581]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "53c962b1-93f4-4a1c-a13c-067c4c90d39c", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "325d462b-44e1-4875-bd11-2d0cabce4677"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
