Available on Magic, \nSpire and Cefas website.\n\nBivalve mollusc (shellfish) harvesting areas are classified according to the \nextent of contamination shown by monitoring of *E. coli* in shellfish flesh. \nTreatment processes are stipulated according to the classification status of \nthe area.\n\nThe classification categories are:\n\n**Class A** (80% of samples must be \u2264 230 *E. coli* /100g; all samples must \nbe less than 700 E. coli/100g) - molluscs can be harvested for direct human \nconsumption\n\n**Class B** (90% of samples must be \u2264 4600 *E. coli* /100g; all samples \nmust be less than 46000 E. coli/100g) - molluscs can be sold for human \nconsumption:\n\n\n-   after purification in an approved plant, or\n-   after re-laying in an approved Class A re-laying area, or\n-   after an EC-approved heat treatment process.\n\n**Class C** (\u2264 46000 *E. coli* /100g) - molluscs can be sold for human \nconsumption only after re-laying for at least two months in an approved \nre-laying area followed, where necessary, by treatment in a purification \ncentre, or after an EC-approved heat treatment process.\n\nIn all cases, the health standards in Annex III of EC Regulations 853/2004 and \nthe microbiological criteria adopted under EC Regulation 2073/2005 must be \nmet. Molluscs must not be subject to production or collected in prohibited \nareas.\n\nThere are two classification systems in England and Wales:\n\n\n(  1.)the annual or \"temporary\" classification system\n(  2.)the long-term classification (LTC) system.\n\nNew areas are initially given annual/temporary classifications until they meet \nthe criteria for an LTC. Harvesting sites that do not meet LTC criteria are \nautomatically classified under the annual/temporary classification system.\n\nClassification: Class A=1, Class B=2, Class C=3, Prohibited=4, Long Term Class \nB=5, Seasonal Class B/Class C=6, Seasonal ClassA/Class B=7\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "2", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "55.75", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.5", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2021-05-07\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "quarterly", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASb1d8dc6c-8874-41fe-a812-a748af5d4a4a", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2021-05-07T14:00:40", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[2, 50], [-5.5, 50], [-5.5, 55.75], [2, 55.75], [2, 50]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "65f8469e-c700-4bcd-a1e4-5446c2ea8e49", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "5e72c4bf-8ff2-444b-91cd-ccf899c01172"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
