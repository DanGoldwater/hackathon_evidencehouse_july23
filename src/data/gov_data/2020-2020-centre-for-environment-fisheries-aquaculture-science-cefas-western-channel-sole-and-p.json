The survey\u2019s main aim is to show trends in the \ndistribution, abundance and age composition of sole (*Solea solea*) and \nplaice (*Pleuronectes platessa*), and to provide some information on bycatch \nspecies. At each station sampled, shot and haul, positional, depth and times \ninformation were recorded, and for all species of fish and shellfish length \ndistribution data were taken. Otoliths were collected from sole and plaice to \nprovide individual age at length information.\n\n Due to the 2020 COVID pandemic, the commencement of the survey was delayed \nuntil November as it could not take place at the time it usually occurs \n(August/September), and the collection of length distribution data had to be \nrestricted to sole and plaice only. \n\n\n\n", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "type": "organization", "description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "image_url": "", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2020-03-20"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2020-11-23"], "title": "2020 - 2020 Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas) Western Channel sole and plaice 2020/21 - Fisheries Science Partnership", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"\\n            Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\\n          \"]"}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "-2"}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "50.75"}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "49"}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "-8"}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]"}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2021-11-26\"}]"}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "annually"}, {"key": "guid", "value": "CEFAS0eb55ef0-27f3-4ba0-a818-ee72980bb0e3"}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2021-11-26T10:54:40"}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "progress", "value": ""}, {"key": "provider", "value": ""}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "series"}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (pointOfContact)"}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-2, 49], [-8, 49], [-8, 50.75], [-2, 50.75], [-2, 49]]]}"}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"}], "resources": [], "tags": [], "groups": [], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "9e64878b-81b9-46a0-93eb-95a278eb19c3"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
