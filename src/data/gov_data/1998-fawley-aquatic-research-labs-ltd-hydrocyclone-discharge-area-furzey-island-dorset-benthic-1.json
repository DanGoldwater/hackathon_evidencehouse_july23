The hydrocylcone abstracts sea water from Poole Harbour for down well injection. The sea water intake is close to the sea bed at the head of a wooden jetty on Furzey Island. Six sites were surveyed, with three replicate 'Day' grab samples taken from each site. The abundance of species at each station has been entered onto the database rather than the abundance of species in each sample. Station position fixing was by GPS and by reference to landmarks, however in the report they are only displayed on a map and not stated directly. Therefore, the coordinates used in the database have been derived from a combination of the Admiralty chart (unknown scale) in the report in conjunction with MapInfo. The methods and sampling stations (where possible) were the same as those used in a baseline benthic survey of the discharge area carried out in December 1995, and results from the two surveys have been compared in this study.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-1.9764", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6851", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.6839", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-1.9836", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-02-12\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "73c2d4da-13ed-42cf-bd84-aa3431cccba6", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2016-11-15", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Dorset Environmental Record Centre (custodian); Fawley Aquatic Research Laboratories Ltd (originator); BP Exploration & Production (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-1.9764, 50.6839], [-1.9836, 50.6839], [-1.9836, 50.6851], [-1.9764, 50.6851], [-1.9764, 50.6839]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
