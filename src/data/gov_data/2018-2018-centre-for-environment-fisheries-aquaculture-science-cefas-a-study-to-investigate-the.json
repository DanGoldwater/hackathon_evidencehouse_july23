This programme was \nintroduced in 2003 to build relationships between UK fishermen and scientists \nand to involve fishermen in the co-commissioning of science. The primary \nobjective of this project was to conduct a survey to assess the effects of \npulse trawling off the English east coast, near to the Port of Ramsgate. The \nfleet of large, predominantly Dutch, beam trawlers has adopted novel pulse \ntrawl technology in recent years. The fishing grounds beyond 12 nautical miles \noff Ramsgate have been identified as a hotspot for pulse trawling with the \nlocal inshore fishermen reporting observations of a detrimental effect to \ntheir fishing grounds, including a perceived reduction in the common sole \n(Solea solea) catches in the area, this perceived reduction in catch is not \naddressed in this report.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "1.74086", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "52.4595", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "52.4581", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "1.73881", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-10-25\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS6e3b40f3-9dbc-44ba-836e-4cd7b99492d8", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2019-10-25T10:24:53", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[1.74086, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4581]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::32600", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "330534a0-f026-4424-b50b-c45f75fe98ff", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "de47f65c-05e0-44de-bdd5-7c35b55430fb"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
