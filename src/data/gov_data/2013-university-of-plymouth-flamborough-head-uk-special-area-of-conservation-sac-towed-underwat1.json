Data were collected using a high definition towed underwater video system . Fourteen areas were surveyed, seven areas were inside the SAC, one of which was a No Take Zone (NTZ) and seven were outside of the SAC. Three replicate 200 m x 0.5 m transects were recorded in each area. Locations of transects were selected based on previous surveys. The survey was commissioned by Natural England as part of a condition assessment to characterise the subtidal epibenthos and habitats within the SAC and in comparable areas outside the SAC. The extent and condition of biotopes was also identified and mapped.", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
