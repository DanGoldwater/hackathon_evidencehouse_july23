Within the project (WFA-CPC EMFF Protecting Our Seas), benthic and geophysical surveys were undertaken in the Severn Esturary/M\u00f4r Hafren SAC to explore the location of Sabellaria alveolata reefs, and collected bathymetry, sidescan sonar, AGDS and acoustic imagery data (ARIS) to identify areas of variable ground or potential features. A ten-day survey was undertaken in July 2020 to collect broad-scale acoustic data using an interferometric swath bathymetric system (GeoSwath Plus) and Acoustic Ground Discrimination System (RoxAnn\u2122 AGDS). Twelve secondary survey areas were selected to be investigated in greater detail using high frequency sidescan sonar and an Acoustic Resonance Inspection System (ARIS Explorer 3000) camera in a second ten-day survey conducted in August 2020 (https://www.envision.uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2018-1008-NRW-WFA-Protecting_Our_Seas_Final_Report_20210201.pdf) The data sets include: SSS (.tif) collected using Trident SeaStar MBES (.xyz) collected using GeoSwath Plus, AGDS (.csv and .asc) collected using RoxAnn\u2122 AGDS ARIS imagery (.png and .mp4) collected using ARIS Explorer 3000 camera Shapefiles (.shp etc)", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 6, "organization": {"id": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "name": "british-geological-survey", "title": "British Geological Survey (BGS)", "type": "organization", "description": "A world-leading geoscience centre for survey and monitoring; modelling and research; data and knowledge.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/home.html\r\n\r\n", "image_url": "2020-08-17-104120.024946BGS-Logo-Pos-RGB-01.png", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:32.295517", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2020-07-19"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2020-08-28"], "title": "2021 Welsh Fishermen\u2019s Association - Cymdeithas Pysgotwyr Cymru (WFA-CPC) Severn Esturary/M\u00f4r Hafren SAC Benthic and Geophysical surveys", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"The copyright of materials derived from the British Geological Survey's work is vested in the Natural Environment Research Council [NERC].
