This survey was undertaken by SNH and Marine Scotland Science (MSS) for SNH on the 24th and 25th September 2015 on board the vessel MRV Alba na Mara (cruise 1415A). Video images were obtained from drop-down video drifts at 11 sites. The main aims of this survey were to monitor MPA management effectiveness and contingency sampling to improve knowledge and distribution of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. The video and still imagery was used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. The presence of protected features (PFs) was recorded for all video samples within the MPA and the presence of priority marine features (PMFs) for all video samples.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.6560", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "56.6886", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "56.4065", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-6.0989", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-07-01\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "60a577ec-8a6f-4f41-afc9-0c646024a22b", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not for navigational use; This survey recorded no species or biotope occurences that SNH consider as sensititive; all records may therefore be released in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations or Freedom of Information Regulations; additionally its re-use and dissemination is permissable under Open Government Licence terms.
