Dropdown video drifts at 49 stations was one of the methods used to achieve this, using MSS vessel MRV Alba na Mara (cruise 1415A). This survey also contributed to a monitoring programme (of management effectiveness) of refining the distribution of Habitats Directive Annex 1 features adjacent to the partially overlapping Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and to a study of the distribution of protected features within the MPA. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. 15 grab samples were also collected at 3 stations during this survey period to help assessment of the condition of the seabed habitats within the MPA. Sampling stations were selected to target the Limaria hains bed and burrowed mud habitat. Faunal identification and sediment particle size analysis (PSA) of the grab samples was undertaken by Seastar Survey Ltd, contracted by SNH.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.5890", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.2858", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.2513", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.7088", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "18ae4158-9a3c-4c06-bc8d-8173fe3fafbd", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not for use in navigation.
