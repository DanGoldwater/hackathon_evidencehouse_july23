SmartBuoys consist of a 4 meter tall stainless steel \nframe with a fibreglass torroid for buoyancy. Instruments are attached at a \nnominal 1 meter depth to the frame. In-air sensors are mounted to the top of \nthe torroid. The buoys feature a satellite telemetry system providing near \nreal-time telemetry. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, \nfluorescence, turbidity and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) sensors were \nfitted to a Cefas ESM2 data logger. These instruments gathered data for 5 \nminutes every 30 minutes. Sensors were validated against in-situ samples \nduring deployment and recovery. The buoy was also fitted with a water sampler \nwhich took periodic samples into pre-spiked (HgCl2) bags for later nutrient \nanalysis. The in-situ salinity and nutrients samples are quality controlled \nvia the Quality Assurance for Marine Environmental Measurements (QUASIMEME) \nscheme.\n\nPAR sensors were calibrated against a standard lamp. Fluorometers were \nstandardised using fluorosphere beads. Turbidity meters were calibrated \nusing Stabical (Hach, US).\n\nThis mooring was also fitted with a thermistor string (multiple temperature \nsensors at various depth), this data is held by BODC.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "1.74086", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "52.4595", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "52.4581", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "1.73881", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-09-16\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASf95015d7-0ca6-4b60-879d-1cd61d30a9ab", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-09-16T13:34:47", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[1.74086, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4581], [1.73881, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4595], [1.74086, 52.4581]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "a343acf8-1f49-45a4-bf49-f2f084a27a06", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "9c7d0448-7359-4df2-9625-68d77e7f2cc3"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
