An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS between the 25th and 27th July 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 25 sites. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.
