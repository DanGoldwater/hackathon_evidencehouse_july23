Data were collected using the lowered CTD rosette system which is used \nwhen the vessel is stationary. Usually bottles were fired at particular depths \nand samples taken for calibration. In early years only a limited set of \nparameters were collected. Notably Pressure (Depth), Temperature and \nConductivity (CTD). From Conductivity Salinity can be calculated using the \nUNESCO 1978,1983 formulations . In subsequent years more sensors have been \nadded, notably fluorometers, Optical back scatter or transmissometers and \nLight (PAR, photo synthetically available radiation). The exact configuration \nvaries between cruises and this is reflected in the data format of the output \nfiles.\n\nData was collected from research vessels on station, a profile from the \nsurface to near the sea bed is undertaken. The down cast data should be a \nclean profile. Water bottles for sample collection and calibration are fired \non the up cast.\n\n\n\n", "num_resources": 1, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "type": "organization", "description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "image_url": "", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "is_organization": true, "approval_status": "pending", "state": "active"}, "owner_org": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "private": false, "state": "active", "temporal_coverage-from": ["2001-06-26"], "temporal_coverage-to": ["2001-07-03"], "title": "2001 - 2001 Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (Cefas) RV CORYSTES 06/2001 High Resolution Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) Data", "type": "dataset", "url": null, "version": null, "extras": [{"key": "UKLP", "value": "True"}, {"key": "access_constraints", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "bbox-east-long", "value": "5"}, {"key": "bbox-north-lat", "value": "56"}, {"key": "bbox-south-lat", "value": "52.75"}, {"key": "bbox-west-long", "value": "-0.5"}, {"key": "coupled-resource", "value": "[]"}, {"key": "dataset-reference-date", "value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-12-18\"}]"}, {"key": "frequency-of-update", "value": "notPlanned"}, {"key": "guid", "value": "CEFASa29c09e1-1212-4d69-a892-864ee3dd14d8"}, {"key": "licence", "value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]"}, {"key": "metadata-date", "value": "2019-12-18T14:13:28"}, {"key": "metadata-language", "value": "eng"}, {"key": "progress", "value": ""}, {"key": "provider", "value": ""}, {"key": "resource-type", "value": "dataset"}, {"key": "responsible-party", "value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)"}, {"key": "spatial", "value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[5, 52.75], [-0.5, 52.75], [-0.5, 56], [5, 56], [5, 52.75]]]}"}, {"key": "spatial-data-service-type", "value": ""}, {"key": "spatial-reference-system", "value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"}], "resources": [{"cache_last_updated": null, "cache_url": null, "created": "2020-09-16T06:06:01.458478", "description": "Resource locator", "format": "", "hash": "", "id": "3024012b-fcfc-413b-9812-3c17738340df", "last_modified": null, "metadata_modified": "2020-09-16T06:06:01.458478", "mimetype": null, "mimetype_inner": null, "name": "", "package_id": "17c4df74-39aa-4b19-ba46-968bcacba698", "position": 0, "resource_locator_function": "order", "resource_locator_protocol": "", "resource_type": null, "size": null, "state": "active", "url": "http://data.cefas.co.uk/#/View/745/", "url_type": null}], "tags": [], "groups": [], "relationships_as_subject": [], "relationships_as_object": [], "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "b915e470-c04e-445b-8841-8fc9658dac68"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
