An underwater video survey was conducted by SNH and Marine Scotland Science (MSS) for MS on the 24th-25th September 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 9 sites within the Wester Ross area, that at the time of sampling was being proposed as a location for a possible Marine Protected Area (pMPA), and grab sampling was undertaken in 3 locations. Analyses on the seabed video and still images, undertaken by Dr Colin Moore commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Infaunal analysis of the grab samples was undertaken by Precision Marine Survey Limited. SNH used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
