The SCM survey was undertaken with the objectives to: establish a baseline biological data set that will facilitate the assessment of the favourable conditional status of the reefs in future; and to allow SNH to form judgement on the current condition of the reefs in light of existing SAC management measures. To fulfil these objectives an extensive drop-down video survey of the sublittoral reef habitats of the SAC at 60 sites to characterise the major reef biotopes and MNCR phase 2 surveys of reef biotopes along relocatable transects at 5 sites spanning both littoral and inshore sublittoral environments.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
