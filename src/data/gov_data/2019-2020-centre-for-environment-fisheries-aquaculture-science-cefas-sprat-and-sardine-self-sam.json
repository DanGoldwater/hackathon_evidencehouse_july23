The primary objective of the project is to improve the data \ncollection on sprat in the South West of England in support of the stock \nassessment, by means of the continuation of a self-sampling programme carried \nout by fishermen and main producers that begun in 2017-2018.\n\nAfter the success of the first year, and some areas identified as requiring \nfurther fine-tuning, the sardine self-sampling programme was continued in \n2018-2019 and expanded to the sprat fishery.\n\nIn 2019-20, the current FSP project had the primary objective: to improve and \ncontinue the data collection for sprat in the South West by means of a \nself-sampling programme carried out by fishermen. Although the focus of \nproject was on sprat data, the project continued to support the third season \nof self- sampling by the sardine fishery as well. Ultimately, the aim of the \nFSP project is that the self-sampling programme for both the sprat and sardine \nfisheries can run autonomously and will (continue to) contribute reliable \nfisheries dependent data to the assessment process for both stocks.\n\nParticipating vessels recorded haul details (date, position, fishing gear), \nand length distributions of around 50 individual sprat and sardine. In \naddition to the data collected by the fishermen, processors agreed to provided \nindividual length and weight information for at least 50 individuals per \nspecies per month.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.5", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "51", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-4", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-12-07\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS00c89b57-0293-4579-8460-66bacf8cdae8", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-12-07T11:29:51", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-2.5, 50], [-4, 50], [-4, 51], [-2.5, 51], [-2.5, 50]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "21e27e37-aefe-4d4e-8303-c3ba069dc7eb", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "0e3825a2-a240-4a86-8226-b2c33d42dd5d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
