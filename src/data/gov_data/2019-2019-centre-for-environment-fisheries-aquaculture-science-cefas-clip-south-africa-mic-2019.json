One file \n(South_Africa_Biota_Microplastics.csv) reports the microplastic abundance in \nbiota samples (anchovies, redeye round herring and sardines) collected and \nanalysed in South Africa in 2019. The file contains data of the samples \nweight, length and number of microplastic items found. Fish is ordered by \n'stratum' (geographical reference, please see \nSouth_Africa_Biota_Microplastics_Strata.doc). Fish of the same species in the \nsame stratum were also stored in bags and a blank was measured in the lab to \nassess contamination while working with specimens from the same bag. Blank \nvalues are also reported. in the file. The file also reports information for \neach sample. Since fish populations were homogeneous in size and shape, body \nweight and length were recorded for only 5 individuals per bag, and averaged \nvalues are reported for all fish from that bag. Stomach weight was measured \nindividually for all specimens. For sardines in strata E and F the lengths and \nweights of each fish were measured, allowing for further analysis on the \nhealth effects of microplastics in sardines. The file \nSouth_Africa_Biota_Microplastics_FishMeasurements.csv reports body weights and \nlength of the specimen actually measured in each bag. A third file \n(South_Africa_Biota_Microplastics_FTIR.csv) contains the profiles of the \nATR-FT-IR spectrum analysis of plastic pieces found in the fish stomachs., \nplus two profiles of known plastic for quality check A README text file \ncontains the legend of the columns of the three csv files.\n\nThe pictures of the plastic particles analysed with ATR-FT-IR can be obtained \ninquiring the data steward.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "40", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "-20", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "-40", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "10", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-09-11\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASd850b418-61a1-43dc-bf02-12f3fb82e4f3", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-09-11T10:02:46", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[40, -40], [10, -40], [10, -20], [40, -20], [40, -40]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4030", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "0311cef2-483c-4acf-a315-cb1f4247f926", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "27d4a84c-c391-4f1e-9363-51e76a6afd9a"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
