The twin rig trawler *Nimrod * was chartered to undertake trials \nin a *Nephrops * ( *Nephrops norvegicus* ) fishery. Eleven days of fishing \ntrials were conducted in the Farne Deeps (FU6: IVb; 38E8,38E9,39E9,40E8 and \n40E9) fishing grounds off the North\u2010East coast of England in November and \nDecember 2017. This enabled catch comparisons of five cod ends of varying mesh \nsize, twine thickness and ircumference to be examined. The primary objective \nof this work was to compare the catch rates of these cod ends as those \nconforming to the latest licence conditions were suggested to be \ncounterproductive by the industry. These measures were introduced in April \n2016 following concerns of historical overexploitation of *Nephrops * in the \nFarne Deeps. The specific object of the project was to develop an optimum cod \nend construction to reduce catches of small *Nephrops* . A total of 27 hauls \nwere completed for eleven days fishing, with 26 of these considered valid for \nexamination.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-0.5", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "55.5", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "54.75", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2018-12-12\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFAS38762f23-5f39-42a3-af47-8cd970e9f7f2", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2018-12-12T12:27:08", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-0.5, 54.75], [-2, 54.75], [-2, 55.5], [-0.5, 55.5], [-0.5, 54.75]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "bcf333b4-8402-49fa-b505-1dab54cdd963", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "8c522134-3596-4fa6-be4a-a11eecbd732e"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
