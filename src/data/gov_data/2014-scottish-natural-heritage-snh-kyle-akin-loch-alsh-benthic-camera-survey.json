This site was selected for survey because it is an MPA. A drop-down video survey of benthic habitats was undertaken by SNH and the Kyle of Lochalsh Community Trust (KLCT) at 6 sites on the 8th of December 2014 on board the vessel Shuna. Analysis of seabed video and still photographic imagery is used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.7170", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.2810", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.2780", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.7300", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2015-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "9d19fecba4d3c14cbeb643a062119838", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
