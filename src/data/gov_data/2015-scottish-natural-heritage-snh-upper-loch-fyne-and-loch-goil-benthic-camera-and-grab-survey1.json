The main aims of the video survey work in the area was for ncMPA monitoring and to refine knowledge of protected feature distribution. The primary aim of the grab survey was to establish current baseline conditions for a range of features present within the site, against which future change can be determined. Video footage photographic imagery were collected at 46 sites and 17 grab samples were collected. Through the analysis of seabed video and stills, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. Grab sample station positioning in Loch Fyne was informed by the results of previous studies and designed to increase confidence in existing knowledge of feature extent and to validate biotopes assigned to towed video in the same area.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.0365", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "56.2523", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "55.9810", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.3957", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2019-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "c013080a-7510-4211-b611-4a4fa0178ddb", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
