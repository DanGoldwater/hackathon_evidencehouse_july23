As such SNH would not release such records in response to an Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004 request at a resolution below that provided by a 20km by 20km square.

However, SNH may choose to share this data at full resolution with Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies and other trusted partners, academic researchers or developers for use in Environmental Statements at full resolution. However, such release would be strictly under the terms of a modified Open Government licence which would restrict published outputs and onward supply to the degraded resolution. Other species or biotope occurrences in this survey are not considered by SNH to be sensitive; as such these may be released at full resolution in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations or Freedom of Information requests; additionally their re-use and dissemination is permissible under Open Government Licence terms.
