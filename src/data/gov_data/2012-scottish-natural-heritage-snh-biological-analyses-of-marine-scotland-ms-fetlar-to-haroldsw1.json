An underwater video survey was conducted by SNH, Heriot-Watt University (HWU) and MS for MS on the 27th-5th September 2012 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 69 sites, grab sampling was undertaken in 19 locations and in situ  diver surveys (MNCR phase 2 style) were undertaken at 5 sites (three horse mussel beds and two maerl beds were investigated). Analyses on the seabed video and still images and infaunal samples by Heriot-Watt University, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. The survey vessel Moder Dy, owned by NAFC, was used from 27th-31st Aug to undertake drop-down video and grab survey work and a second vessel MZ Halton was used from 1st-5th September to undertake diving work.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
