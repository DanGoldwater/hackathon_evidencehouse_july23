This site was selected for survey because it is an MPA. A drop-down video survey and a grab survey of benthic habitats was undertaken by SNH from the 25th to 26th March 2014 on board the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) research vessel Sir John Murray. Underwater video footage was collected using DDV camera system at 52 sites within the MPA. Analysis of seabed video and still photographic imagery is used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance. On the same survey and research vessel, SNH collected single infaunal grab samples at 12 stations for Marine Scotland.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.5166", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.2980", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.2426", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.7773", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2015-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "441bc6b9-ff68-4f9c-b615-18588a480f4a", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Not to be used for navigation.
