An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by MSS for MSS between the 23rd October and 3rd November 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 35 sites around Shiant East Bank and 25 sites in Little Minch. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. An infaunal survey was also undertaken in this area on the same survey by MSS and SNH for SNH, with the same purpose as the video survey to collect quantative biological data. A total of 17 samples were collected during this survey for faunal and PSA analysis. Seastar Survey Ltd was contracted by SNH to undertake the infaunal analysis. MSS and SNH used the vessel MRV Alba na Mara for this survey - video samples were also collected from Little Loch Broom on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
