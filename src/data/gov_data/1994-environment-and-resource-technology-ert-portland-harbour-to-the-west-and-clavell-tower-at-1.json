A copy of report and complete collection of catalogued slides, bound in a separate volume, are held at Dorset Environmental Records Centre.\n\nThis survey was carried out by Environment and Resource Technology (ERT) for Amoco. Diving fieldwork took place between 16-25 September 1994, during which 29 stations were sampled in the area bounded by Portland Harbour to the west and Clavel Tower at Kimmeridge to the east. MNCR survey protocols were used, with sampling carried out by diver pairs skilled in in situ fauna and flora identification. Infaunal samples (0.1m sq, 20cm deep and 1.0mm sieved) were obtained at some stations using a Hardy-Barnett suction sampler. Station positions were fixed using a hand-held GPS on the OSGB36 spheroid.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.1348", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6367", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.5528", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2.4373", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-02-12\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "aefdda65-4971-4485-b2f4-3e684bb7091b", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2016-11-15", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "DASSH,  The Archive for Marine Species and Habitat Data (originator); Dorset Environmental Record Centre (custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-2.1348, 50.5528], [-2.4373, 50.5528], [-2.4373, 50.6367], [-2.1348, 50.6367], [-2.1348, 50.5528]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
