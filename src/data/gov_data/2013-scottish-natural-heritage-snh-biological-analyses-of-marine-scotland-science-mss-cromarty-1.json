This site was of interest because the area is a spoil ground, located southeast of the entrance to Cromarty Firth. An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 7th June 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 3 sites. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. MSS used the vessel FRV Alba na Mara for this survey.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
