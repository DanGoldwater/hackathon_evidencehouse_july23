A copy of the report is held at Dorset Environmental Records Centre.\n     This survey was carried out by Environment and Resource Technology Ltd (ERT) for Amoco. The area between Portland Bill to Kimmeridge Bay was surveyed, including Portland Harbour. 77 seabed samples were obtained from 74 different locations between 16-26 September 1994. Four different sampling methods were used due to the range of sedimentary substrata occurring in the survey area. The majority of samples (63) were taken by van Veen grab (sample size 0.1m2). These were then hand-sifted through both 1.0 and 0.5mm mesh and sorted into major faunal groups for counting and identification to species level by specialist taxonomists. The species lists entered into this database relate to the 1.0mm mesh results. Positions were fixed using DGPS with NAVBOX software and are given on the WGS84 spheroid.", "license_title": "", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.1692", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6319", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.4925", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2.4450", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-02-12\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "2ef541931a4851ff7363c165268a58d6", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.
