The potential ecological and economic impacts of this species are significant. A rapid response eradication programme in Holyhead Harbour is currently underway, showing signs of some success so far. However, it is not known how far this species has spread within the UK, and surveys are underway in England and Wales to determine its distribution. It is crucial to know as soon as possible how far it has spread, as\n     this information will determine what the appropriate response will be - if it is confined to only a few sites, it may be possible to attempt eradication. If it is already more widespread, then containment or control measures will be more appropriate.\n     No specific surveys targeting this species had previously been carried out in Scotland, so it was not known whether it was present just in the one marina in the Clyde or whether it was more widespread. This project involved a series of rapid assessment surveys of those marinas and harbours thought to be most likely at risk from establishment (e.g. those in the Clyde and on the west coast of Scotland) and will inform SNH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy for dealing with this species, as well as the wider UK policy for response.", "num_resources": 2, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
