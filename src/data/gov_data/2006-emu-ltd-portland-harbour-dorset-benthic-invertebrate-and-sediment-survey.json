The original survey was carried out as part of the Environmental Statement submitted with the planning application for the redevelopment of the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy site (WPNSA) undertaken at that time. \n     The present survey was constructed with advice from English Nature and relates to planning applications that among other aims, will involve dredging of an inshore area, relating to further marina construction, in close proximity to WPNSA building itself, in Portland Harbour.\n     The survey undertaken for YHG Ltd was combined with a survey already commissioned by the WPNSA whose focus was mainly the population of Armandia cirrhosa (the lagoon sandworm) in Portland Harbour. The structure of the surveys enabled them to be amalgamated, with some sites to be shared regarding the sampling regime, and an agreement was entered into by YHG Ltd and WPNSA to share any data relating to infauna, contaminants and particle size distribution. For that reason additional data from the survey for WPNSA is included here in the relevant areas and in selected appendices where appropriate, either for presentation purposes or for access to data as required by YHG Ltd. Any specific information that the YHG Ltd may wish to access that is not presented here, will be a matter for the relevant parties to discuss amongst themselves as required.\n     The main objective of the survey was to undertake a full benthic invertebrate analysis of the area, along with the related Particle Size Analysis (PSA) of the associated sediments and to establish likely effects, if any, on the invertebrate community as a result of construction undertaken in the area.", "license_title": "", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions to public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-2.4000", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "50.6000", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "50.5000", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-2.5000", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2013-02-15\"}, {\"type\": \"creation\", \"value\": \"2005-07-22\"}, {\"type\": \"revision\", \"value\": \"2013-02-15\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "6d8b03289fdf496b0fe4713c0f31f178", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Data is freely available for research or commercial use providing that the originators are acknowledged in any publications produced.\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2021-02-17", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "EMU Limited - Head Office (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-2.4000, 50.5000], [-2.5000, 50.5000], [-2.5000, 50.6000], [-2.4000, 50.6000], [-2.4000, 50.5000]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "organization": {"description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
