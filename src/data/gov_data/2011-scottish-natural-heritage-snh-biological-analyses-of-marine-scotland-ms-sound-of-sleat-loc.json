An underwater video and still photograph survey was conducted by SNH for MS on the 15th and 16th June 2011 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 35 sites in the area. The images, analysed under SNH contract by Dr Colin Moore, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. SNH used the SEPA vessel SV Sir John Murray for this survey - footage was collected from the Sound of Canna on the same cruise.", "num_resources": 0, "num_tags": 0, "organization": {"id": "c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df", "name": "marine-environmental-data-information-network", "title": "Marine Environmental Data & Information Network", "type": "organization", "description": "MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
