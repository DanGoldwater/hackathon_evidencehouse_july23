The aim of the survey was to establish \nwhether a commercially viable stock of razor clam existed in this area. The \nsurvey was delayed by inclement weather, but was eventually completed in \nFebruary 2010.\n\nThe Seafish/Cefas experimental water-jet dredge was employed north of Walney \nIsland, but there were problems in deploying the gear safely. Those problems \nadded to the sea-time lost through poor weather. In all, 34 dredge deployments \nwere made, but at only 26 of these did the dredge fish successfully.\n\nWhere the dredge did work well, good catches of the razor clam Ensis siliqua \nwere taken; up to 17 kg in a 10-min haul, although the average catch was ~5kg. \nThe razor clam caught covered a wide size range and young animals from at \nleast two year classes were present, suggesting that successful recruitment is \na regular occurrence in the population. The adult population had a modal size \npf 185 mm shell length.\n\nThe highest biomass in by-catches was contributed by the heart urchin \nEchinocardium cordatum., Several clam species, two possibly with commercial \npotential, were found regularly.\n\n\n\n", "license_title": "UK Open Government Licence (OGL)", "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-3", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "54.5", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "53.75", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-3.5", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2020-06-16\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "CEFASc180d8d9-e10b-4496-ac9e-21226c4db362", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"Public data (Crown Copyright) - Open Government Licence Terms and Conditions apply\"]", "key": "licence"}, {"value": "2020-06-16T13:06:52", "key": "metadata-date"}, {"value": "eng", "key": "metadata-language"}, {"value": "", "key": "progress"}, {"value": "", "key": "provider"}, {"value": "dataset", "key": "resource-type"}, {"value": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (originator, custodian)", "key": "responsible-party"}, {"value": "{\"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[[-3, 53.75], [-3.5, 53.75], [-3.5, 54.5], [-3, 54.5], [-3, 53.75]]]}", "key": "spatial"}, {"value": "", "key": "spatial-data-service-type"}, {"value": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326", "key": "spatial-reference-system"}], "license_url": "http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence", "organization": {"description": "The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is a world leader in marine science and technology, providing innovative solutions for the aquatic environment, biodiversity and food security.\r\n", "title": "Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science", "created": "2012-06-27T14:50:51.521004", "approval_status": "pending", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "", "revision_id": "ce84bb7e-1d2d-4db2-9e43-ba1c1a8e6158", "type": "organization", "id": "2f1c6ccb-3f21-40c0-8b26-41566c53eb2f", "name": "centre-for-environment-fisheries-aquaculture-science"}, "revision_id": "e59ebc68-a8fd-419e-af1f-60efbe02361e", "harvest": [{"key": "harvest_object_id", "value": "729a3513-c85c-4d43-bd25-211e2f0352f8"}, {"key": "harvest_source_id", "value": "1a2a2e3d-a51e-4046-8c8b-e8ad3856dd9d"}, {"key": "harvest_source_title", "value": "Cefas WAF endpoint for data.gov.uk"}]}}
