An underwater video survey were conducted by MSS for MSS on the 11th February 2013 to collect detailed biological information on the seabed species and habitat features present. Drop-down video drift tows were undertaken at 10 sites in this survey area which forms part of the Wyre and Rousay sounds ncMPA. Analyses on the images, commissioned by SNH, were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages.
