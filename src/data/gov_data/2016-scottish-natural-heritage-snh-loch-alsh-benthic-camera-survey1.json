Dropdown video drifts at 16 stations where used to achieve this, using MSS vessel MRV Alba na Mara. This survey also contributed to a monitoring programme (of management effectiveness) of refining the distribution of Habitats Directive Annex 1 features adjacent to the partially overlapping Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and to a study of the distribution of protected features within the MPA. Through the analysis of seabed video, the images were used to describe the nature of the seabed in terms of the physical structure and the species assemblages. Runs and run segments were assessed for the presence of protected features and other PMFs, as well as for the presence of species and habitats of recognised conservation importance.", "license_title": null, "extras": [{"value": "True", "key": "UKLP"}, {"value": "[\"No restrictions on public access\"]", "key": "access_constraints"}, {"value": "-5.5890", "key": "bbox-east-long"}, {"value": "57.2858", "key": "bbox-north-lat"}, {"value": "57.2513", "key": "bbox-south-lat"}, {"value": "-5.7088", "key": "bbox-west-long"}, {"value": "[]", "key": "coupled-resource"}, {"value": "[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2017-12-31\"}]", "key": "dataset-reference-date"}, {"value": "notPlanned", "key": "frequency-of-update"}, {"value": "f241d930-d3f3-46a7-ab77-98a102abe774", "key": "guid"}, {"value": "[\"This survey recorded no species or biotope occurences that SNH consider as sensititive; all records may therefore be released in response to requests covered by Environmental Information Regulations or Freedom of Information Regulations; additionally its re-use and dissemination is permissable under Open Government Licence terms.
