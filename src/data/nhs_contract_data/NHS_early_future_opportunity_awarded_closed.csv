The preventing suicides in England strategy, March 2021  estimates that annually 800,000 people across the world die by suicide, with 5,316 people sadly taking their life in England in 2019.

Within the NHS Long Term Plan, the NHS's made a commitment to make suicide prevention a priority over the next decade, implementing a new Safety Improvement Programme across all mental health trusts, and setting out important measures to improve crisis care services.

Part of the funding has been used to improve pathways and support for patients (including children and young people and people with personality disorder) presenting with self-harm, including in acute hospitals and mental health services. 

Finally, the ICS will consider consistent and cost-effective bereavement support pathways across the ICS, including enhancing data sharing agreements across organisations and improving real time surveillance.

•	Referral to a specialist Gender Dysphoria Clinic 
•	Assessment for gender dysphoria, and diagnosis
•	Individuals who meet the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria are accepted on to the NHS care pathway and an individual treatment plan is agreed between the individual and their lead clinician in the Gender Dysphoria Clinic
•	Certain therapeutic interventions are delivered by the Gender Dysphoria Clinic; and / or referral for interventions with other providers; which may include recommendations to primary care for prescribing endocrine treatments
•	Gender Dysphoria Clinic makes a referral for surgical interventions of the chest and genitals if criteria are met via a planned National Referral Support Service
•	Ongoing review and monitoring during and after interventions
•	Conclusion of contact: discharge to primary care

NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit on behalf of NHS Herefordshire CCG, NHS Redditch & Bromsgrove CCG, NHS South Worcestershire CCG and NHS Wyre Forest CCG (which will henceforth be known as 'the CCGs'), is seeking to engage with potential Providers for the provision of non-emergency patient transportation services.

The CCGs intend to jointly go to market in March 2019 under Schedule 3 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015 to procure a non-emergency patient transportation service for the health population of the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. It is likely that the duration of the service contract will be five (5) years, with the option to extend for an additional two (2) years, subject to agreement. 

The aim of the market engagement event will be to engage with potential providers for these services in order to share the commissioning intentions of the CCGs, and to seek the input from providers on a number important aspects relating to the services, including the service specification. The CCGs would like to assess the current market appetite to provide this service and identify any barriers to successful implementation. The outcomes of the market engagement event will then determine next steps. 

Please note, as the service specification is still under development, the estimated contract value of £20m (for the 5-year period) is an indicative figure only, intended as a guide, and may be subject to change prior to any future procurement exercise.

At the event, the commissioning authority will also present information regarding the proposed procurement process and procurement time line.

At the event there will also be an opportunity for providers to network with other providers and the commissioners.

The event will be held on: 
Wednesday, 30th January 2019 
At: 10am to 12noon (Registration from 9.30am)
Location: The Meeting Room, Malvern Community Hospital, 185 Worcester Road, Malvern WR14 1EX.

Each year the NHS provides around 110 million urgent same day patient contacts, with around 85 million of these being urgent GP appointments and the remaining being though A&E or minor injury clinics.
In Sussex the NHS 111 service takes around 363,000 calls a year, with 75% being taken out of hours (6.30pm-8am).  Within the existing Kent, Medway Surrey and Sussex contract around 43% of the total calls taken are for Sussex.
The Commissioners have agreed to offer the contract as a 5 year initial term with a single option to extend forup to a further two years (5 +2 = 7 years maximum duration) at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. The Commissioners will take the view to extend to the full seven years as soon as it is appropriate but with the first consideration at 18 months and thereafter at regular intervals. The vision for a more integrated urgent care system across Sussex will improve patient care and choice, as well as, streamlining and improving services for staff working in both primary and urgent care. The new NHS 111, Clinical Assessment Service and Out of Hours Service will be vital in the journey to integrate urgent care across Sussex. 
The Commissioners have set a maximum total financial envelope of £72.72m for the seven year maximum duration of the contract.

It was the first healthcare system free at the point of service.  In October 2020, the NHS became the world's first healthcare system to commit to reaching net zero

Reaching this goal matters. The core purpose of the NHS is to improve patient and community health outcomes. Climate change threatens this purpose, undermining the foundations of good health and putting the NHS, its staff, and the people it serves at risk. Tackling climate change is lifesaving, with health benefits gained through cleaner air, active lifestyles, and improved diets. As the UK's largest employer, contributing 4.6% of carbon emissions, the NHS is part of the challenge and the solution. It has a collective responsibility to act, with all 1.3 million staff having a role to play.

The second half of 2021 offers renewed hope. The UK will host COP26 - the world's largest climate action conference. This major international event provides a focal point to inspire raised ambition across the NHS and beyond. As the NHS emerges from the crisis phase of the pandemic, restrictions relax, and the external agenda on climate action intensifies, there is a converging opportunity for the Greener NHS team to re-affirm the NHS commitment to Net Zero and re-engage staff in showing their support for building a Greener NHS - and a healthy, sustainable recovery.

Complementing other targeted communications activity within and beyond the NHS, we will launch a staff engagement campaign in the second week of July - following on from the NHS Birthday, as a means to look forward - after what has been moment of reflection and thanks for what has gone before. The campaign will launch ahead of the Olympics, leading up to our Net Zero Ambition Anniversary [30th September], and culminating in COP26. 

Staff Engagement Campaign Objectives
It will take the support of all 1.3 million staff to ensure the NHS reaches its net zero goal. We want to launch a grassroots staff engagement campaign in the second week of July through to COP26, that will:
•	Build understanding and support among NHS staff in its Net Zero ambition and the importance of building a greener NHS to improve health now and for future generations
•	Inspire NHS staff to pledge support or take an action that demonstrates tangible support for a Greener NHS and/or reduces their carbon footprint, contributing to the overall net zero ambition

The scope of this non-emergency patient transport (NEPT) service shall include provision of NEPT to and from the following healthcare premises of the following NHS Trusts or other services: • Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust; • Birmingham Women’s Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; • Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust; • Royal Orthopaedic NHS Foundation Trust; • University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust; • Worcestershire Acute Hospital NHS Trust (for BSOL CCGs only); • GP referrals for same day assessment (for BSOL CCGs only) • Or other secondary or community NHS service as defined by the commissioners.

1. Please provide details of any experience you have in delivering/managing similar services. 
2. From when do you have capacity to deliver the contract from? Please provide brief details on current and future capacity.

PR003252/AN,Contract,"NHS SOUTH WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT",Awarded,2020-01-30T16:22:41Z,"AWARD NOTICE - NHS Commissioning Board (NHS England & NHS Improvement South East and South West): Provision of School Aged Immunisations for Hampshire, Southampton, Portsmouth, Isle of Wight & Dorset","NHS England & NHS Improvement South East and South West sought to commission immunisation programmes aimed at school aged children across the following three geographical lots:
•	Dorset (including Bournemouth, Christchurch & Poole)
•	Hampshire
•	Solent (Portsmouth, Southampton & the Isle of Wight)

The purpose of national immunisation programmes is to protect the population from vaccine preventable illnesses and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality and the burden this places on health services. This includes reducing the risk of individuals infecting others (herd immunity), particularly those who cannot be vaccinated either because they are too young or for medical reasons. Collectively the programmes protect young people against a range of infectious diseases which can lead to death or severe, permanent disability requiring long term care such as limb amputations, brain injury, paralysis and cancer.   

The aim of the project is to secure provision, for each of the Lots, which can achieve and sustain high levels of coverage  of the immunisation programmes in scope overall as well as at the level of individual schools/communities and population groups e.g. those who typically have difficulty accessing services. Coverage will be measured in the year the vaccination is first offered and in subsequent school years. The ambition is to be in the top quartile for the country for each vaccination programme and in each lot.  

There are currently four programmes for children of school age relevant to this procurement:
•	the Seasonal Influenza immunisation programme
•	the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) immunisation programme
•	the Tetanus, Diphtheria and inactivated Polio (Td/IPV) adolescent booster programme 
•	the Meningitis ACWY immunisation programme

In addition, the provider will offer a catch-up service for under-immunised children in line with the national measles eradication strategy. 

The programmes are continually evolving. By 2020, the HPV programme will have been extended to boys as well as girls and the flu programme will have been extended to school year 6. Further school years may be announced for the flu programme in due course. The scope may also be extended in future to include additional programmes, as advised/ recommended by the Joint Committee of Vaccinations and Immunisations and/or at the request of the commissioner. Any provider will have to demonstrate an ability to respond positively to programme changes and implement them in a timely fashion to a high standard.  

The contract term will be 5 years, with the option to extend by a further 2 years, and will commence on 1st August 2020. 

Interested parties were allowed to bid for one or more lots. Evaluations were based on Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT).

This Procurement process is looking to address and improve the connectivity that links primary care optometry and the hospital eye service which is seen as key to improving eye care services in England. 

The ambition is to have numerous trained and well-equipped primary care optometrists with the ability to make clinical decisions based on quantitative and imaging clinical data. This will provide significant opportunities to use digital connectivity to improve eye care.

NHSX considers digital solutions that increase connectivity between different providers of eye care horizontally and vertically, and across primary and secondary care, to be a key enabler for the national outpatient transformation programme. This will rapidly restore and ensure continuation of eye care services during COVID-19 and transform how services are delivered in the future.

The South East Region consists of six Integrated Care Systems and Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships, 30 NHS trusts and 17 Clinical Commissioning Groups.

Such clinics may be staffed by Consultant Dermatologists, Specialty and Associate Doctors, General Practitioners with Special Interests or specialist Dermatology nurses, but new services should be developed in partnership with secondary care.

NHS Redditch & Bromsgrove CCG, NHS South Worcestershire CCG and NHS Wyre Forest CCG jointly procured a Community Dermatology Service to deliver a high-quality, consultant-led service for all patients across Worcestershire in community settings. This will enable patients to receive care closer to home and will improve patient access and enhance patient experience.

A key aim of the new service will be the future provision of high quality, effective care that is patient focused and will be achieved through collaborative and multi-disciplinary working across Worcestershire.

The Worcestershire Consultant-Led Community Dermatology Service will work in close collaboration with secondary care providers and GP colleagues; excellent communications between providers will support service delivery. Working with GP colleagues will help to increase knowledge and confidence for further management of long-term conditions in primary care.

The Worcestershire Consultant-Led Community Dermatology Service will be provided across a number of locations across Worcestershire, all locations will be capable of providing all elements of the service. The various locations will provide equitable access for patients across Worcestershire. The Service will include a full tele-dermatology service (i.e. where it is offered as an alternative for a face-face appointment).

The commissioning bodies have awarded one contract. The contract duration will be two (2) years, with the option to extend for a further one (1) year, subject to agreement. The new service will commence on the 1st April 2020. The contract values stated at Sections 1 and 6 are the maximum estimated total lifetime cost of the contract should the optional extension be used. NHS Standard Terms and Conditions shall apply.

•	refer patients to other NHS services as appropriate in line with the relevant local protocols and guidance;
•	establish a positive working relationship between the Commissioner and Provider to facilitate and maximise high quality service delivery;
•	develop services in line with the evolving strategic approach to primary care dental provision and align with the priorities of the NHS Long Term Plan - www.longtermplan.nhs.uk;
•	promote overall health in line with Making Every Contact Count.

This process is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

This notice is an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right, and therefore publication or response does not commit the Commissioner or respondents to a future procurement, nor provide any process exemptions or preferential treatment to any parties expressing an interest. Commissioners are looking to establish what interest there might be in providing such a service from suitably qualified, capable and competent organisations.

The Commissioner will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this exercise. Interested parties should note that a response to this notice does not guarantee an automatic invitation to any subsequent formal procurement, which the commissioners will consider in due course.

Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust have awarded a contract for an Electronic Eyecare Referral System via the DPS on behalf of NHS England and NHS Improvement London Region.

This Procurement process is looking to address and improve the connectivity that links primary care optometry and the hospital eye service which is seen as key to improving eye care services in England. 

The ambition is to have numerous trained and well-equipped primary care optometrists with the ability to make clinical decisions based on quantitative and imaging clinical data. This will provide significant opportunities to use digital connectivity to improve eye care.

NHSX considers digital solutions that increase connectivity between different providers of eye care horizontally and vertically, and across primary and secondary care, to be a key enabler for the national outpatient transformation programme. This will rapidly restore and ensure continuation of eye care services during COVID-19 and transform how services are delivered in the future.

There are 17 major trust providers covering over 31 sites in London and 936 optical practices across 5 Integrated Care Systems (North East, South East, South West, North West and North Central London).  Each Integrated Care System (ICS) has its own configurations of optical practice software and ophthalmology IT systems with some optical practices and ophthalmology departments still using paper records.

The team will be accessible to all agencies (e.g. social services, YOTs, prisons, courts, solicitors, education, health commissioners etc.) that may have contact with young people exhibiting risky behaviours or young people in the youth justice system who have mental health difficulties.

NHS Black Country ICB and NHS Derby and Derbyshire ICB intend to undertake a procurement process for NHS 111 services to cover the West and East Midlands regions (including Staffordshire and Stoke) on behalf of themselves and the following Integrated Care Boards:

•NHS Birmingham and Solihull ICB
•NHS Coventry and Warwickshire ICB
•NHS Herefordshire and Worcestershire ICB
•NHS Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland ICB
•NHS Lincolnshire ICB
•NHS Northamptonshire ICB
•NHS Nottingham and Nottinghamshire ICB
•NHS Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin ICB
•NHS Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent ICB

Providers are invited to a market engagement event on the morning of the 20th April 2023 in central Birmingham. Further details will be communicated to registered providers.

NHS111 aims to ensure patients with an urgent clinical need are assessed and referred to an appropriate service, in a timely manner, by providing health advice and onward referral over the telephone and online. The NHS111 service will deliver a safe and patient focused service that promotes quality and reduces health inequalities.

Further objectives of the service will be to:
• Achieve nationally and regionally mandated KPIs and quality measures.
• Expedite patient access to appropriate end point services.
• Deliver good patient experience by providing consistent, safe and efficient clinical assessment at first point of contact.
• Provide onward referral to primary care and all non-emergency department (non-ED) pathways, including ICB commissioned services that can undertake remote triage and onward referral (such as local clinical assessment services (CAS)).
• Nurture a culture of self-help, education and self-management.
• Ensure the Directory of Services (DoS) is maintained in partnership with local systems and used to facilitate timely and appropriate levels of care.
• Ensure early identification of calls that would benefit from access to a clinical adviser.
• Develop and maintain clear pathways of care which ensure safe and optimal transfer of patients' care where additional or specialist care is required.
• Reduce the risk of harm to patients by ensuring patients are referred to the most appropriate service, at the earliest opportunity along the pathway.
• Share real time data with health and social care partners to improve the patient journey, safety of staff, and the efficiency of NHS and Local Authority commissioned services.

It is anticipated that the service will receive circa 5.5m calls per annum, Midlands wide. Contract duration 5 years + 2-year extension option.

This PIN relates to services within scope of Schedule 3. The Commissioners and AGCSU are, therefore, bound only by those parts of the Regulations applying to Schedule 3 services (""Light Touch Regime"").

One priority targeted in Road Investment Strategy 2: 2020-2025 is a ""maintenance approach that will focus on safety and surface condition to enhance the quality of journeys"". This project is being commissioned to partly address the surface condition aspects and the ride quality that road users experience. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the progression to better ride quality will result in smoother pavement surfaces overall, and this presents a secondary, but equally important, opportunity related to National Highways' zero carbon plans . Smoother road pavements yielded through ride quality improvements should offer lower rolling resistance to transiting vehicles, and therefore reduce their fuel consumption (or increase the range of electric vehicles). This presents an opportunity to mitigate some of the 'road user emissions' that feature prominently in our carbon baseline, that need to reach net zero by 2050.",,,"South East","73000000 ",,SPaTS2@highwaysengland.co.uk,"The Cube, Wharfside Street,",,Birmingham,"B1 1RN",England,,,"T0230 Award Letter - FUTRAN.docx ",,,06/01/2022,31/03/2023,07/12/2021,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,259776.46,,06/01/2022,259776.46,"[FUTRAN Joint Venture|Wokingham|NONE_OTHER||No|No]",,06/01/2022,31/03/2023,"CallOffFromFrameworkAgreement ",,19:00

NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSEI) National Commercial and Procurement Hub are undertaking market engagement in relation to the digital requirements that will support the  Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework (CPCF).

Technical toolkits have been developed in relation to the following CPCF services, with NHSEI seeking feedback from suppliers as to the viability of the toolkits building on the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS) technical toolkit that has already been agreed and published. The exercise is designed to invite feedback and move towards the publication of these toolkits as a standard requirement for software suppliers supporting CPCF services that will include clear timescales for implementation. 

It continues to be the intention that in the future, pharmacy contractors will be mandated to use an appropriate IT system if providing the service. 

The technical toolkits relate to:

•Discharge Medicines Service (DMS), which is an essential service for all    pharmacies;

•New Medicine Service (NMS), which is being delivered by 90% of pharmacies;

•Blood Pressure Check Service, with over 6,900 pharmacies registered to deliver this service and an anticipated uplift on service delivery this over the 2022/23 financial year;

•Smoking Cessation Service (SCS), with 2,200  pharmacies registered within the first 2 months of the service, to provide the follow up support for patients recently discharged from hospital. All acute NHS Trusts in England are required to implement a smoking cessation service with access to discharge follow up by 31 March 2024;

An updated version of the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS) technical toolkit is now available after being published on the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) website. 

This engagement activity is aligned with the development of the APIs for the above services to support remuneration and the sharing of data for service evaluation and commissioning purposes, which is being led by the NHS BSA. 

Suppliers who wish to participate in this engagement exercise will require access to the National Commercial and Procurement Hub's Intend portal page. 

Please register through the Intend e-procurement system (https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home) for further instructions.

Together the CCGs’ locality can be referred to as Bradford District and Craven.  

Bradford district is unusual in the high levels of poverty and diversity; hence, it is not representative of the rest of the country, although there are similarities with other UK cities and with cities with high levels of ethnic minority and immigrant communities across the world.  Almost half of babies born in the city have parents of Pakistani origin.  
Around 20% of the population is of South Asian origin (90% of whom are from Pakistan), and this constitutes a three-generation community that maintains close links with Pakistan.  Almost half of the South Asian population in Bradford is of Mirpuri origin.  Mirpur is a predominantly rural district in the province of Azad Kashmir in Pakistan.  Some members of the community do not read or speak English.  However, the majority are able to understand Urdu or Mirpuri, although not all are literate in Urdu.  Of the patients attending the specialist fertility clinic, approximately 50% are of South Asian origin, 45% of white British origin and 5% of Eastern European origin.

Bradford district and Craven is served, in the main, by two local hospitals – Airedale NHS Foundation Trust and Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.  The Provider must establish and demonstrate robust relationships and pathways of care with local obstetrics and gynaecology departments for care of women during pregnancy.  This assisted conception service is considered tertiary in nature and the majority of referrals will come from the two local hospitals. 

All assisted conception treatment in the UK is statutory regulated by the Human Fertility and Embryo Authority (HFEA).  The Commissioner will only commission fertility techniques regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).  All tertiary providers of fertility services must be licensed with the HFEA in order to be commissioned.  

The most recent DH costing tool estimates that there are 98 attendances at a fertility clinic for every 10,000 head of population.  In Bradford Districts and City, this currently averages around 15/week for general fertility and 5/week for the specialist reproductive medicine service.  Of these, some patients will be fee-paying.  IVF cycles average in the region of 250 per year.  

The successful providers(s) will be offered an AQP standard NHS contract. It should be noted that `under the Any Qualified Provider model, there will be no guarantees of volume or payment in the contracts awarded.

As such, the CCGs wish to engage with the wider market via a Request for Information (RFI) process, in order to potentially inform future service model development and/or commissioning intentions.

The increasing levels of obesity in the UK are well documented; it has been estimated that the combined medical costs of an extra 11m obese adults nationally could be £2bn a year, equating to £100m annually for the health economies of the North East and Cumbria.

Tier 3 weight management services are typically designed for obese individuals who have not responded to previous interventions, and are comprised of a multi-disciplinary, clinically-led team of specialists.  Tier 3 weight management services are a pre-requisite in the NICE eligibility criteria for Tier 4 bariatric surgery and are integral to a tiered approach to management of obesity. The overarching aims of any such service would be to reduce obesity rates, prevent related illnesses, and lower the number of patients needing referral into Tier 4 bariatric surgery.

NECS is managing this RFI process for and on behalf of the above-named CCGs. If your organisation would like to register an interest in responding to this market engagement exercise and obtain a copy of the Request for Information documentation please go to the NECS E-Tendering Portal: https://in-Tendhost.co.uk/necs . If your organisation has not previously registered on the NECS E-Tendering Portal, please ensure that you do register in order to access the RFI documentation. It is free to register on the portal, which can be accessed at any time of day.

Once registered, to view details of the RFI exercise, please navigate to “Request for Information - Tier 3 Specialist Weight Management Service” and select “View Details”. Please then select the button marked “Express Interest” – you will then be able to access the RFI documentation.

SCCL is responsible for driving commercial objectives, managing Category Management Service Providers, and enabling services whilst overseeing continuous improvement.

By 2022/2023 we aim to save the NHS £2.4bn by leveraging the scale of the NHS to drive savings and provide a standardised range of quality assured clinical products that meet the diverse needs of the NHS across all areas.

NHS Supply Chain provides a leading procurement and supply chain services to hospitals and healthcare providers, to help leverage national expenditure whilst providing a resilient, sustainable national supply chain. The organisation is at exciting cross-roads, having recently defined a new 10-year vision to enable it to better meet the needs of the NHS and bring its value proposition to a broader range of healthcare
providers. It currently provides (B2B) services to almost all Trusts in England, as well as operating a small but critical and growing home delivery (B2B2C) business. This increased diversity of customers lays the foundations for future requirements for the business, as healthcare becomes more integrated regionally, through integrated care systems (ICS).

NHS Supply Chain captures customer demand through a range of solutions including a core catalogue, EDI order feeds, through a forecast driven automated replenishment model, and through orders triggered by inventory usage (e.g., in theatres for high value products). Some of these solutions are over 30 years old, unstable, aren't flexible and are unable to adapt to our strategy or external changes.

The organisation is at a relatively early stage of a 3 - 5 year transformation to re-platform its core Front Office and Digital Commerce solutions, and dramatically improve the user experience and interface to offer an experience which is comparable to those offered by for example leading retailers. NHS Supply Chain's
mission is to provide the NHS with a modern and intuitive ordering experience to increase Customer satisfaction, make it easier for the NHS to put Patients first and be flexible to adapt to the changing needs of the NHS. Modernisation is also an imperative part of our longer-term vision to be easy to work with and enable further adoption of NHS Supply Chain's services.

In order to deliver upon the Mission, NHS Supply Chain are seeking an eCommerce Solution and Delivery partner to provide a single tailored and intuitive ordering platform, managing personalised content delivery across web and mobile channels whilst supporting integration with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and 3rd

Successful Bidders will hold a single contract with NHS England, and services under that contract will be available to individuals eligible for NHS-funded care who are ordinarily resident in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - or otherwise who are the commissioning responsibility of the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - and who meet the various eligibility criteria described in the Commissioner's Service Specification. 

The NHS pathway of care for adults with gender dysphoria will differ according to the individual's goals. The envisaged adult pathway may typically be summarised as: 

•	Referral to a specialist gender dysphoria service that is commissioned by the NHS
•	Assessment for gender dysphoria, and diagnosis
•	Individuals who meet the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria are accepted on to the NHS care pathway and an individual treatment plan is agreed between the individual and their lead clinician in the NHS gender dysphoria service
•	Certain therapeutic interventions are delivered by the NHS gender dysphoria service; and / or referral for interventions with other providers; which may include recommendations to primary care for prescribing endocrine treatments
•	NHS gender dysphoria service makes a referral for surgical interventions of the chest and genitals if criteria are met via a National Referral Support Service
•	Ongoing review and monitoring during and after interventions
•	Conclusion of contact: discharge by NHS gender dysphoria service to primary care

The approach for improving the surgical market is focused on establishing a flexible contract that facilitates patient choice based on a consideration of reliable data including new quality indicators. No volumes are guaranteed on the award of a contract. Contracts will be awarded to all providers who meet the minimum standard criteria.

The NHS Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS) was commissioned as an Advanced Service from 29th October 2019, with the expectation that additional strands to the service will continue to be tested, developed and introduced into the contract. At the time of the service commencement for the specified IT solutions, the referrals will be made by NHS 111 or the Integrated Urgent Care Clinical Assessment Services (IUC CAS) and General Practice. NHS E/I are seeking to establish a DPS to outline entry level requirements. Pharmacy contractors will then be able to introduce additional requirements through the development of specifications which will support further tendering opportunities under the DPS.

NHS E/I have been exploring the development of a specification, which would determine the entry requirements to the DPS. To continue this exploratory work and to consider further elements relating to the establishment of a DPS, NHS E/I are inviting feedback from existing and potential suppliers. Included within this notice is a market engagement questionnaire, with feedback invited by 12.00 noon on 16 November 2020.",,,England,"72000000 ","Darryl Jones",commercial.procurementhub@nhs.net,"South Plaza,Marlborough Street",,BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,07467339206,,,,"Interested providers will be able to view this notice via the 'current tenders' list on the e-procurement system InTend, available on the following link: https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home

It is intended that the framework will be established from March 2017 for 4 years, with contracts being awarded to support Service Users either directly by the CCG, or on the basis of patient choice.

The services to be offered through the framework are intended to include:

• Support planning
• Payment service (including Third Party/Managed Account)
• Employer advice and guidance

These PHB Support Services will support both adults and children who have been approved to receive a PHBs by the CCGs. 

Please see the attached Draft Service Specification for further details of the CCGs' requirements.

Whilst uptake of PHBs by Services Users is currently low, a significant increase is expected over the next 5 years as the CCG plans to award at least 222 PHBs over the next 5 years to meet the intentions published by NHS England. As a consequence, the expected spend profile for NHS Merton CCG to framework providers is:

The overall aim is to source an expert provider with the capacity and expertise to work with the national TM leads network to develop one approach to organisational TM diagnostics. The provider should then work with us to pilot and refine this approach (most likely across the Midlands and East region due to this being the most mature RTB, and comprising of approximately 71 NHS provider organisations and 59 CCGs. However there is potential to extend the pilot across wider geographies - up to another 20 organisations. Therefore approximately 150 in total) so that the data can be shared both with the organisations themselves, and pooled together to strategically support the RTB ambitions. The final solution should be simple in its approach and ensure that internal NHS resources are able to run the diagnostic approach in the future for all RTBs as they develop and reach maturity. Ideally the diagnostic should be suitable for NHS organisational Boards to progress themselves internally with no external support or supervision.

The funding available for this work is within this NHS financial year (April 2018 - March 2019) and we see the work being completed within this period. Ideally the tool will be developed and piloted in the first 3 quarters, and then enhanced and ready to be scaled and spread during the final quarter of this financial year. We acknowledge these timescales are demanding and see potential for the provider to continue support with us into 2019-20 to 'hold our hands' whilst we fully roll out the tool to all RTBs nationally.

NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE & NHSI), South East (Wessex) are seeking to commission Mandatory Dental services in the Portsmouth, Alton and Tadley area, and will be holding a procurement process to award new contracts for service commencement from September 2020.

At this time, the Commissioner(s) would like to gather information from providers from all sectors using a market sounding questionnaire to inform the procurement process. 

A market engagement workshop event is being proposed for December 2019 but a subsequent notice for this will be issued.

The key aims for Mandatory Dental Service provision are to:

•	provide access to NHS dental services to ensure equity and consistency of provision
•	deliver appropriate, efficient and cost effective services within the service provision framework of the NHS (General Dental Services/Personal Dental Services) Regulations 2005 and any subsequent revisions
•	provide high quality dental services that meet the needs of people wishing to attend an NHS Dental practice in Portsmouth, Alton and Tadley which may include flexible appointment times and accessible services
•	provide access to patients identified as having an urgent dental need via NHS 111 
•	refer patients to other NHS services as appropriate in line with the relevant local protocols and guidance
•	establish a positive working relationship between the Commissioner and Provider to facilitate and maximise high quality service delivery
•	develop services in line with the evolving strategic approach to primary care dental provision
•	address the needs of vulnerable groups by incorporating elements of the Starting Well Programme to reduce oral health inequalities and improve oral health of children under 5 years old, residents of care homes and other vulnerable groups

The route to market for the various service elements and geographies is still being determined but, as a guide, the procurement is anticipated to commence from January 2020, inviting tenders to deliver services for specific lotted areas, with contract commencement anticipated in September 2020. 

The market sounding questionnaire will be used to obtain feedback from the market to help inform the re-commissioning and procurement of these services.

This is a pre-procurement exercise to better understand the market and potential suppliers that can deliver the requirement. The outcome of this engagement will inform the procurement strategy. 

PROJECT BACKGROUND

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the relationship between the NHS and the Armed Forces with collaborative efforts in the delivery of testing services, the establishment of NHS Nightingale hospitals, supporting the PPE supply chain and infrastructure to local systems.

This joint and collaborative working has highlighted that members of the Armed Forces Community have many skills which are highly sought after by employers within the NHS. 

The requirement is for a bespoke programme designed to support the employment of members of the Armed Forces community (service leavers, reservists, veterans and armed forces family members) within the NHS. The programme will support potential and current employees of the NHS and employers in the NHS.

The programme will work with both employers within the NHS and potential / current employees to introduce a series of measures designed to support the needs of both parties. These include, for example, reviewing existing recruitment and HR practices to remove barriers to the Armed Forces Community, advertising employment opportunities with the Career Transition Partnership, introductory workshops, candidate insight days, mentoring opportunities and, the provision of work placements.

The Deliverables for this requirement go beyond standard recruitment support and will be looking for supplier who can deliver the following:

- Developing candidate insight days that meet the needs of both candidate and employer.
- Raising the profile of employers within the NHS with candidates and organisations that provide employment support.
- Working with professional bodies to support the employment of clinical staff within the NHS.
-Developing networks to enable employers within the NHS to collaborate on workforce issues.
- Providing advice to employers within the NHS on NHS recruitment practice and workforce planning matters.
- Working with the Ministry of Defence and its agencies and military charities to support the Armed Forces community in employment within the NHS.
- Ensuring this project would align with broader NHS workforce policy objectives such as the NHS People Plan.
- Measuring the success of the project.
- Developing an evidence base on the benefits to the NHS of employing members of the Armed Forces Community.

      - To make early cost savings by reducing the non-pay spend on our High-Volume Routine Pathology Activity and to enable us to improve our workforce efficiency and productivity individually within our services as currently configured.
      
      Southern Counties Pathology is therefore looking to: -
      - Procure a long-term strategic partnership with core Managed Service Provider(s) (MSP)

The Commissioner is now looking to refresh (re-procure) the Clinical Communications Tool framework to continue with the core aims of modernising the communications and tasks management systems throughout the NHS.

NHS organisations require dedicated modern communications and task management systems to enable staff time to be saved by reducing their need to use the historic 'bleep' system or by sending emails and numerous telephone calls. Staff need to share clinical information quickly and securely whilst at work (including between NHS Organisations and associated service Providers to the NHS), using tools that can be turned off when not at work.
The National Health Commissioning Board is continuing to look at Clinical Commissioning Tools services in the NHS, which include the following interventions:

Address critical pain points for clinical and/or operational teams.
Release time for individuals and teams of NHS staff.

Set up in July 2012, the Academy brings together, for the first time, all national activity supporting leadership development in health and NHS funded services.

The principal purpose of the Academy is to develop outstanding leadership in health, in order to improve people's health and their experiences of the NHS. The challenges facing the NHS require our leaders to build on their existing strengths - and develop new ones.
Our philosophy is simple - great leadership development improves leadership behaviours and skills. Better leadership leads to better patient care, experience and outcomes. Our purpose is to work with our partners to deliver excellent leadership across the NHS to have a direct impact on patient care. We offer a range of tools, models, programmes and expertise to support individuals, organisations and local academies to develop leaders, celebrating and sharing where outstanding leadership makes a real difference.
The aim of the GMTS is to identify and recruit top graduate talent and develop them into the next generation of healthcare leaders.  It is an award winning scheme which has been running for 60 years. A selection of some of its received awards can be found here: http://www.nhsgraduates.co.uk/the-scheme/what-we-offer-you/#tab-award-winning
 The Scheme is hugely oversubscribed, and in 2015, we received over 16,500 applications for approximately 112 places. In 2016, we received 16,500 applications for approximately 130 places; to start in September 2017.  
During the 60 years the GMTS has been in existence, approximately 4,450 people have started it. The current and previous Chief Executive of NHS England is an alumnus of the GMTS.
The purpose of the NHS Graduate Management Training Scheme is to identify, grow and support the future leaders of the NHS. Great leadership development improves leadership behaviors and skills. Better leadership leads to better patient care, experience and outcomes. 
It is essential that the graduate scheme provides the NHS with future leaders who can demonstrate the personal qualities and will have the required values and behaviors, key skills, and energy that will be required to provide a new world class, patient-led healthcare system for England. The NHS needs emerging leaders who are skilled at:
•	Inspiring Shared Purpose - Valuing a service ethos; curious about how to improve services and patient care; behaving in a way that reflects the principles and values of the NHS
•	Leading with Care - Having the essential personal qualities for leaders in health and social care; understanding the unique qualities and needs of a team; providing a caring, safe environment to enable everyone to do their jobs effectively
•	Evaluating Information - Seeking out varied information; using information to generate new ideas and make effective plans for improvement or change; making evidence-based",,,"Any region","73000000 80000000 ","Anthony Oba",anthony.oba@hee.nhs.uk,"1st Floor, Blenheim House","Duncombe Street",Leeds,"LS1 4PL",England,"+44 1132952075",https://hee.nhs.uk/,,,,03/09/2018,31/08/2022,11/06/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,100,100,,,,,,,"NotApplicable ",

NHS MLCSU is working on behalf of NHS Southport & Formby CCG and NHS South Sefton CCG who wish to award a contract for Eyecare Services - specifically a Pre-Cataract assessment service (Pre-Cats) and a Glaucoma Repeat Reading (GRR) service.

Glaucoma Repeat Reading Service 

The aim of the Glaucoma Repeat Reading Service is to reduce false positive referrals to the hospital; reducing patient anxiety and increasing capacity within hospital glaucoma clinics.

The pathway is for patients referred, usually following sight test, for further investigation with signs suspicious of glaucoma but without clinical circumstances indicating urgent or emergency referral.


Pre-Cataract Assessment Service

The pre-cataract assessment pathway is evidence based and uses best practice guidance to improve the patient journey and clinical and cost effectiveness. This should lead to a reduction in unnecessary referrals as releasing much needed secondary care appointments, ensuring patients are fit for surgery at point of referral and shift of some parts of the pathway into primary care closer to the patient.

The service utilises the skills of primary care optometrists to confirm the presence of cataract, counsel the patient with the use of shared decision making and to refer on if the patient chooses and meets the CCG cataract surgery policy to the patient's choice of provider. 

Most cataract referrals are made by the patient's optometrist. The patient should be referred to the unit of their choice. If the patient is under the current care of an eye unit, that unit should be considered the first choice or at least be informed and consulted about the referral. Cataract surgery performed without reference to ocular co-morbidities increases the risk of surgery and a poor outcome.

The contract will be awarded from 1st December 2020 to 31st March 2022.  This is to enable time for commissioning intentions to be reviewed across the system based on both local and national priorities, in particular:
•	The COVID-19 Eye Care Restoration Service (CECRS) specification that has been developed under the NHS England and Improvement (NHSE&I) National Eye Care Restoration and Transformation programme, part of the NHSE&I National Outpatient Transformation Programme (NOTP) published in October 2020.
•	The recommendation from The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, the College of Optometrists and the Association of Optometrists in February 2020 that CCGs should commission services as defined by the Clinical Council for Eye Health Primary Eye Care Service Framework from primary care optical practices  ensuring that only patients whose conditions need secondary care input are seen in hospital thus improving capacity for patients with serious and sight-threatening conditions.

It is increasingly important to prepare the NHS for the potential surge in demand of primary care services both as a direct result of Covid-19 and as we move into the recovery phase of the Covid-19 response, to support (i) people who have not attended General Practice during the Covid-19 outbreak with other clinical conditions, (ii) people who have had Covid-19 who require ongoing support from general practice care once discharged from a secondary care setting (iii) people most at risk of Covid-19, including people in care homes. This will require rapid mobilisation of sessional clinical capacity, and specifically GP locums who can be utilised across primary care to respond to this demand flexibly and efficiently. 

For this purpose, NHS England & NHS Improvement are now conducting an urgent framework procurement utilising the Accelerated Open procedure to implement a digital solution for the deployment of Sessional Clinician Capacity into General Practice.  Providers are invited to offer a solution which makes both COVID-19 shifts and non COVID-19 shifts available and enables practices to post these available shifts, with individuals easily indicating their availability and selecting shifts that suit them. Contracts awarded will reflect this.

The service will be awarded as a framework for the use of CCGs and other relevant Authorities, and it is anticipated that a maximum of 6 providers will be awarded contracts.  The framework will be for an initial duration of 6 months, with a possible extension of a further 6 months.

Lot 1 - Patient Discharge and (inter-hospital) Transfers (PD&T)
Lot 2 - Planned NEPTS Journeys (Planned)

The County of Somerset covers a large geographical area. It has a dispersed, mainly rural population of approximately 564,000 people, with only one in four of its residents living in one of its three largest towns; Taunton; Yeovil; and Bridgwater. 
Somerset has two Acute Trusts within its borders (Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) as well as 12 community hospitals (run by Somerset NHS Foundation Trust), 64 GP practices, a hospice and several care homes. The Somerset population also relies on access to services in a few neighbouring out of county Trusts. These journeys, referred to as Zone B journeys, are generally for services which are more specialist in nature. 
Full details for each of the Lots including specification, activity, scope and requirements can be found within the procurement documentation. For the avoidance of doubt this procurement does not cover car services.
Bidders should be aware that NHS Somerset has appointed Somerset NHS Foundation Trust as the Lead Provider Trust for Lot 1 - Patient Discharge and (inter-hospital Transfers) with the responsibility of managing this activity. The successful provider will contract directly with Somerset NHS Foundation Trust via the NHS Standard Contract - subcontracted for this element. For the avoidance of doubt NHS Somerset will contract with the successful Lot 2 - Planned provider for this service. 
The duration of the agreement will be for 60 months, with an option to extend up to a further 24 months at the discretion of the Commissioner.
The contract value per annum for each lot is:

•	Lot 1 PD&T - £1,818,120 giving a contract value of £9,090,600 for the initial 60-month period and £12,726,840 if the full extension period of 24 months is adopted.

•	Lot 2 Planned - £3,240,824 giving a contract value of £16,204,120 for the initial 60-month period and £22,685,768 if the full extension period of 24 months is adopted.

NHS Practitioner Health (NHSPH) was commissioned in 2016 to provide free and confidential mental health assessment and treatment services for health professionals (as service users) with complex needs and circumstances, and with the current contract due to end March 2022, we are considering our options to appoint a new contract from April 2022 for 2 years until 2024, with the option to extend for further 2 years until 2026.

NHSPH operates in a unique space where there is a crossover between the professional and regulatory environment in which a clinician or health professional works, and their mental health treatment needs.  NHSPH expertise lies in managing the confidentiality associated with accessing health care, taking responsibility for the safety of the service user accessing NHSPH but also the professional and patient responsibilities and risks associated with a health professional's role. NHSPH's understanding and experience are in the mental health presentation of health professionals, especially where this is a high risk of suicide, and the specialist support they may require to return to safe, effective practice.  More information about NHSPH, its objectives and how it operates can be found in the attachments and NHSPH's website: https://www.practitionerhealth.nhs.uk/

NHSPH will operate alongside local staff Mental health and wellbeing Hubs which will support the majority of health and social care staff mental health needs.  A small number of healthcare professionals may require more complex support which cannot be met by the hubs; this is the purpose of NHSPH. More information about the hubs can be found in the attachments and NHS England's website: https://www.england.nhs.uk/supporting-our-nhs-people/support-now/staff-mental-health-and-wellbeing-hubs/

-	To ensure a nationally consistent offer to health and social care staff with complex mental health issues, and a single point of access for local Mental Health and Wellbeing Hubs to refer into.

-	To ensure patient choice and the ability to be seen anywhere across England i.e., out of area services, due to not being able to access local services as a result of confidentiality issues e.g., staff who are likely to be well known by local services.

-	To maintain a good level of standards and good service quality, patient experience, and outcomes, which has been achieved through the central contracting approach.

-	To minimise any disruption to service users and ensure continuity of access to mental health services during the pandemic.

-	To avoid any potential cost pressures to commissioners which may be required to re-organise and transition to regionally based contracts.

-	To ensure consistency of service as a result of a single national commissioner, whilst the NHS goes through its commissioning transformation and reorganisation.

Our key objective from this soft market testing is to establish how the market has moved on and developed in this sector and the capability of interested parties to run the service across England.  Organisations that express an interest should read all the supporting documentation prior to completing the Soft Market Testing Questionnaire, to ensure they understand the full scope of services required.

In addition to the Soft Market Testing Questionnaire, we will also hold an online Market event on Tuesday 29th June at 1 - 2pm, where we will be able to answer any questions about this notice and associated documents.

The CCG is undertaking further market engagement in order to seek the views and opinions of those organisations that may be interested in delivering the service. The purpose of this engagement is to inform the market of the CCG's intention to procure the service, and to invite potential providers to provide input into the service specification and tariff development.
Attached to this advert is a draft service specification. The CCG will be holding a number of Engagement Discussions over a 2 day period, to discuss the service specification and approach to developing a financial tariff.  The CCG considers provider input to be extremely valuable and all those interested are invited to attend one of these sessions.  They will be held on a 1:1 basis i.e. there will be only 1 provider in each session with the CCG. Each session will last approximately 1 hour.

The Engagement Discussions are currently planned to take place as follows:
Day 1
Time: To be confirmed
Date: 2 October 2018 
Location: NHS Shared Business Services, Halyard Court, 31 Broadway, Salford, M50 2UW.

Day 2
Time: To be confirmed 
Date: 21 September 2018
Location: NHS Trafford CCG, Crossgate House, Sale, M33 7FT.
Providers are invited to state their preference of date and morning or afternoon.  The CCG will endeavour to meet any such preferences though can provide no guarantee.  Following the response deadline of 4pm on 26th September 2018, the CCG will notify each provider of its date/time slot and location details.  Places will be booked on a first come first served basis. In the event that there is a greater demand for Engagement Discussions than available slots, the CCG will endeavour to arrange additional sessions.
It is likely that this potential contract opportunity will be subject to a competitive procurement process to enable the CCG to identify the most suitable and qualified providers to deliver the service. Responses to this market engagement will be used to inform the procurement and service approach and as such, a response is important.

A lack of interest being expressed in response to this invitation, may be taken as evidence by the CCG that a competitive process may not be required, so potentially interested providers are advised to respond.

The following 15 Clinical Commissioning Groups are collaborating to procure an NHS111 and Clinical Assessment Service across Kent, Medway and Sussex; NHS Swale, NHS West Kent, NHS Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley, NHS Medway, NHS Ashford, NHS Canterbury and Coastal, NHS South Kent Coast, NHS Thanet, NHS Coastal West Sussex, NHS Brighton and Hove, NHS Horsham and Mid Sussex, NHS Crawley, NHS High Weald Lewes Havens, NHS Eastbourne, Hailsham and Seaford, NHS Hastings and Rother Clinical Commissioning Groups.

The contract will be for a period of 5 years with the option to extend for a further 2 years subject, but not limited to satisfactory performance.

The procurement is split into a number of regional lots across England so as to provide maximum flexibility to both the Commissioner and bidders, based on the corresponding TB Control Region.

NHS England on behalf of its Authority(s) anticipates that it will enter into a Framework Agreement with a maximum of 3 Framework Providers for each regional lot.

The Collaborative Tuberculosis Strategy for England: 2015 to 2020 (‘the Strategy’) published in January 2015 by NHS England and Public Health England (PHE), set out approaches to be taken to support TB prevention, treatment and control. This includes the setting up of TB Control Boards to plan, oversee, support and monitor all aspects of local TB control. The Control Boards will have representation from CCGs, NHS England, Public Health England, local authorities, local TB service providers and others. However, the formal responsibility for commissioning NHS TB services will continue to rest with CCGs.

LTBI can be diagnosed by a single, validated blood test (interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)), and is usually treated with antibiotics, preventing active TB disease in the future. Where patients’ test results show that they are LTBI positive, treatment is offered via referral to an appropriate TB service.

The service to be provided includes: 
•           arrangements for the collection of the sample from the phlebotomy source
•           handling and processing within the specified time limits of the test assay being employed
•           the provision and analysis of the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) test for identification of LTBI.
•           standard operating procedures for the laboratory analysis
•           interpretation and reporting and feedback of the results and: 
•           the monitoring of quality and turnaround times. 

The framework duration will be for an initial period of 3 years, with the option to extend for a further period of 12 months. The service commencement date is anticipated to be in the period between the 13th November to 10th December 2015. 

To formally express interest in the interim provision of the service, and receive full details, please respond through the In-Tend portal at https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home.

The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.

HEE wishes to commission NHE Employers to publish both the Centre's Governance Maturity Matrix and an updated interactive Podiatry Toolkit on the NHS Employers website. The Maturity Matrix will be a self-help tool for employers across the NHS to use and have a narrative of how to use advanced practice with signposting to relevant resources. NHS Employers team will engage with employers through the dedicated networks with colleagues across the NHS on the governance and work with colleagues to develop good practice case studies.
2.1.	The Centre's Governance Maturity Matrix Toolkit
2.1.1.	Employer engagement
2.1.2.	Creation of good practise case studies
2.2.	Podiatry toolkit

HEE believes that it is highly unlikely for any other supplier to be able to provide the following skills/tools provided by NHS Employers as a current supplier for the following reasons:

NHS Employers is the employers' organisation for the NHS in England, they have established networks with Human Resource Directors across the whole of England, as well as training and education leads, recruitment managers and apprenticeship leads which are key to ensuring the messages we want to raise in relation to the allied health professional workforce and advancing practice are heard by these workforce leaders. They are also part of the NHS Confederation and as such have established links to employers within Mental Health, Primary Care, and Integrated Care Systems, which will support our work in raising the profile across the entire system.

NHS Employers host the current employers' guide to podiatry, mean this tool can be updated rather than created. The current users will be notified of the update, rather than the need to rebuild engagement from the ground up on another platform.

This puts NHS Employers in an un-parallel position to publicise, socialise and engage with employers as they strive for a safe and effective workforce.

The CCGs with NHS Liverpool CCG acting as the co-ordinating or lead commissioner, have a vision for their 'out of hours' Urgent Primary Care Medical Services as part of an integrated single model of urgent care services across the whole health economy, providing a high-quality clinical service with a clear patient centred focus.
The CCGs have come together to procure a single service that will work closely alongside and integrate service delivery with the North West NHS 111 service, in line with the national expectations for an integrated 'consult & complete' delivery model. In the North West we have a delivery model whereby the NHS 111 service is delivered by the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) at a regional level and which then works in an integrated and seamless manner with the sub-regional delivery of 'out of hours' primary care services. This pragmatic approach reflects the need to deliver an integrated solution but within the challenges of a large, complex and diverse population and geography.   
The main aim of the service is to provide evidence based urgent primary care which optimises health and wellbeing and reduces the impact of ill health during the out of hours period, avoiding where possible the need for acute care.
The CCGs are seeking to engage high-quality Providers with experienced delivery and leadership in 'out of hours' services / integrated urgent care, with demonstrable capability in managerial and clinical performance that will ensure a safe, clinically effective and affordable service for our patients.
In line with Public Contract Regulations, the CCGs are tendering their requirements with the intention to award a single core contract, supplemented by some local service variation and requirements.  
The anticipated, maximum total contract value (including any potential extensions) is £82,845,310 (ex VAT), with an upper affordability threshold for core services of £80,266,309 (ex VAT),  and an annual upper affordability value for core services of £11,466,616 (ex VAT).

Market Sounding 


PROCUREMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF THE INTEGRATED URGENT CARE SERVICE (111/Out of Hours Services) ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH WEST LONDON CLINICAL COMMISSIONING GROUPS 

The North West London CCGs listed below will be inviting tenders for an Integrated Urgent Care Service (111/Out of Hours services) in North West London. The North West London CCGs will be the contracting authorities and are listed below:- 

NHS Brent CCG, NHS Harrow CCG, NHS Hillingdon CCG, NHS Central London CCG, NHS West London CCG, NHS Hammersmith & Fulham CCG, NHS Hounslow CCG and NHS Ealing CCG.

The Invitation to Tender will be open to all suitably qualified providers. This notice is voluntary and does not mean that the Contracting Authority accepts that the Regulations apply to this intended procurement to any greater extent just by virtue of the publication of the notice or utilisation of a particular procurement process.  

The Keogh Urgent and Emergency Care Review proposes a fundamental shift in the way urgent and emergency care services are provided, improving out of hospital services so that more care is delivered closer to home and hospital attendances and admissions are thereby reduced. There is a need, therefore, for a system that is safe, patient centred, sustainable and provides consistently high quality.

The core vision for a more closely Integrated Urgent Care service builds upon the success of NHS111 in simplifying access for patients and increasing the confidence that they, local commissioners and the public have in their services.

The offer for the public will be a single entry point - NHS 111 - to fully integrate local urgent care services in which organisations collaborate to deliver high quality, clinical assessment, advice and treatment. This will include shared standards and processes and with clear accountability and leadership.

It is anticipated that the procurement process for this service will start in mid-2016, and, subject to a successful procurement process, the service will go live in Q1 2017/18.


The Contracting Authority intends for the contract to be awarded for a 3 year duration with the possibility of up to 1 (one) extension for 2 (two) years, subject to any restrictions placed nationally by NHS England or the Department of Health.

The following draft service specification document is intended to provide additional information on the Service. The draft service specification is still undergoing development and this market engagement exercise is part of that process. The draft service specification will be under development up to the publication of any Invitation to tender (ITT).",,,London,"85000000 ","Kieran McGowan",kieran_mcgowan@nhs.net,"NHS Shared Business Services","Chandlers Point, Halyard Court, 31 Broadway, Salford",Manchester,"M50 2UW",England,,,"Early Engagement Notice Response Form.docx Engagement Questionnaire.docx NWL Integrated Urgent Care DRAFT Service specification.pdf ",,"Providers are requested to submit their views on the draft service specification (and to complete the attached market sounding proforma and questionnaire if they wish to and have not already done so), and emailing them to kieran_mcgowan@nhs.net by no later than 5.00pm on Monday 18 April 2016.

NHS Vale of York is acting as lead commissioner for this procurement on behalf of NHS Vale of York CCG and NHS Scarborough and Ryedale CCG

The aim of the service is to manage minor eye conditions in an optometrist-led community setting.  It is expected that the service will control unnecessary and inappropriate referrals to Emergency Department, and Out Patient attendances for minor eye conditions.  The MECS will utilise the knowledge and skills of primary care ophthalmic practitioners to deliver a specialist primary care optometry service, providing assessment and interventions which are beyond the scope of General Practice, but not requiring secondary care ophthalmology management.    Patients will be managed within the service, in line with the scope and acceptance criteria.

After consideration of the most recent clarification question and previous questions, NHS GG&C have carefully considered a number of different submission options to ensure the least impact and inconvenience for Suppliers regarding the size limits of Bid submissions. Therefore, bid submissions are required to be submitted slightly differently than as described in the Bidder Instructions. To ensure size limitations are mitigated, all Bid responses must be provided on a word document, containing a link to a Secure File Transfer, which should be uploaded to the this Tendering site. The word document should contain the name of the Supplier and third parties with a direct clickable link to the secure file transfer location. It is NHS GG&Cs preference that no password is used, however, if a password is required, then this should also be included within the Word document. It is the responsibility of the Supplier to ensure that the Link works and is accessible to NHS GG&C. Any responses received after the deadline of 9am on 4th October 2022 will not be accepted.  It can also be confirmed that any documents or bid submissions with time stamps after this deadline will be disqualified and Suppliers will be excluded from the Procurement process.

As a result, we have operated a national staff support helpline since April 2020, to support our NHS and Social Care staff who are under enormous pressure every day. The NHS and Social Care staff helpline was also a key recommendation of the NHS Staff and Learners' Mental Wellbeing Commission report in 2019: 'A national NHS and Social Care helpline service should be developed with the aim of providing a complete emotional support service to NHS and Social Care staff and those learning in the NHS'.

Common themes that have emerged on the helpline in the past 18 months, that we want to continue supporting our staff with include -
• Concerns about the workplace or study
• Mental health issues / concerns
• COVID-19 concerns
• Family issues
• Isolation/loneliness
• Physical health/illness
• Relationship problems

The helpline is also identifying to a lesser extent, concerns relating to:
• Bereavement
• Violence/abuse
• Finance/unemployment
• Drug and/or alcohol misuse
• Bereaved by suicide

The requirement is for a staff support helpline, to continue to provide a psychological support offer for all NHS and Social Care staff. This will aim to be a service provided for all staff during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond. The service is provided for all health and care workers across the country. Currently the helpline has experienced over 14,000 contacts directly.

The support line will offer NHS and Social Care staff the opportunity to converse with trained crisis support workers, and if required, qualified clinical support where needed. The requirement will be to run a 7-day service, that can operate nationally, and is able to cater to all groups and demographics. The service will need to operate at the least, between 7:00am-11:00pm daily.


Pre-market Engagement

NHS England & Improvement are currently undertaking an options appraisal and as part of this have issued a Notice to the market to gauge supplier interest and capability in relation to continuing the delivery of this service.

NHS England & Improvement are aiming to enter into a 12-month contract with an approximate Year One value (12 months) of £600,000 exclusive of applicable VAT. Dependent on budget and performance the contract may be extended for a further 2 years.

The contract will serve an eligible population of approximately 187,000 women aged 50-70, as well as half of the 49,500 women who are 47 to 49 or 71 to 73 as part of the national age extension trial funded separately  by PHE.

The major aim of the NHS breast screening programme is to reduce mortality from breast cancer.  
The successful bidder will be required to deliver a screening programme which is fully compliant with all relevant national standards and pathways and which includes the following elements:

•	Identification and invitation of the eligible female population for screening at appropriate  intervals (i.e. call/recall) in accordance with national guidance
•	Providing appropriate information to allow women to make an informed choice about whether or not to participate in screening
•	Providing high quality, accessible, effective people-centred mammography screening services
•	Ensuring GPs are informed of screening in their area, and the final outcomes of screening invitations for each of their patients
•	Undertaking assessment and diagnosis of individuals with abnormal initial test results;  accurately diagnosing cancers, with reference to MDT decisions; and referring women for treatment by appropriately trained and qualified specialists in accordance with nationally agreed protocols and treatment pathways
•	Managing screening according to national protocols for women with specific conditions which place them at high risk for developing breast cancer
•	Working with other local stakeholders to maximise uptake, improve quality and tackle inequalities and improve outcomes.
•	Delivery by suitably trained, competent and qualified clinical and non-clinical staff who, where relevant, participate in recognized ongoing Continuing Medical Education, Continuous Professional Development, and EQA schemes, using equipment which meets the NHSBSP standards of image quality and radiation dose, with audit embedded in the service

The population to be served by the programme will be those covered by the following 6 CCGs:  NHS East Surrey, NHS Guildford and Waverley, NHS North East Hampshire and Farnham, NHS North West Surrey, NHS Surrey Heath and NHS Surrey Downs.

NHS E wish to be clear that the age extension trial is commissioned via a separate agreement between PHE and the provider of the breast screening programme in Surrey, and not by NHS E under the contract that will be let via this procurement process. More information can be found in the ITT documents. For transparency purposes as the programme provider will also deliver the age extension trial, the total contract value stated in this notice includes £380,604 per annum of age extension funding.

ADVERTISEMENT FOR PROVIDER ENGAGEMENT DAY

Since early 2014, NHS South Cheshire CCG and NHS Vale Royal CCG have been working on their Connecting Care Strategy. This Strategy is ambitious, and underpins the CCGs’ plans for the radical transformation of the capability, effectiveness and culture of the local health and social care economy in which they operate. The Strategy exists to deliver the CCGs’ vision of “Connecting Care in communities to ensure good quality, personal, seamless support in a timely, efficient way to improve health and wellbeing”.
The review and re-commissioning of Community Services is an integral element of the Connecting Care Strategy, and is regarded as the catalyst for care services across the local health economy to be delivered in a more integrated way - in order to secure the needs of service users and improve the quality and efficiency of those services. It is the overall plan for the health and social care footprint across the CCGs’ area, with local provision at its heart. The Strategy is aligned with the NHS’ 5 Year Forward View, published in October 2014.
The CCGs are currently considering their options for commissioning community services across their localities.  As part of this, they have embarked on a process to allow them to decide on the most appropriate route to identify a provider (or providers) most capable of securing the needs of service users, and of improving their quality and the efficiency with which they are delivered. Possible routes may include a suitably designed and managed process involving providers invited to develop a solution, or an open procurement. The route that is chosen will be the one best suited to the fulfilment of the transformation underpinned by the Strategy.
The CCGs would like to invite any providers who might be interested in hearing about the CCGs’ collective vision for the future delivery, within their locality, of integrated pathways of community services which are patient-centred, of high quality, and joined-up. The CCGs will expect the future delivery of community services to involve collaborative working amongst a number of providers, enhancing local staffing opportunities and using local health infrastructure, regardless of legal and organisational form.",,,"North West","85100000 ","Beverley Thomas",Beverley.Thomas@staffordshirecss.nhs.uk,"Heron House",Fenton,Stoke-on-Trent,"ST4 4LX",England,,,,,"In order to set out their vision and strategic priorities, the CCGs will be holding an information and engagement day on Thursday 28th January 2016 between 14.00 and 16.00 at the Reaseheath College, Nantwich, Cheshire, CW5 6DF Directions to the Centre can be found at:

A sustained and targeted communications programme is now needed to build public awareness and show how the NHS's Long Term Plan (LTP) will deliver improvements for patients and good value for the taxpayer.

Research consistently shows that the NHS is the most important priority that people want Government to tackle. Whilst overall experience remains positive (and the UK public are more positive about our health service than people in most other developed nations), there is growing concern about the level of funding that the NHS is receiving and the services that people are getting as a result and concern about its future. DHSC research indicates that only 13% expect that the NHS will get better over the next few years, whereas 52% think it will get worse. 

Public reaction to the funding settlement has been broadly positive with Autumn 2018's Budget committing the additional funding without required tax rises. This is a significant increase in the proportion of tax payers' money being devoted to the NHS.  

Our communications challenge is to build public confidence that the NHS has a positive long-term future - delivered through the NHS LTP. And that this plan will deliver value for money on tax payers' investment.

Initially communications activity (January - Summer 2019) will focus on ensuring both the public and the 1.4 million NHS staff:
-	are aware of the LTP and understand its ambition; and
-	feel that they have a say in how their hard-earned money is spent at a local level (via participation in local engagement activities planned to support the development of local service plans); and

The Authority is looking to redesign respiratory services locally and develop a truly integrated respiratory team capable of delivering ""joined up care at the right time in the optimal setting"" as set out in the NHS Long-Term plan. The ambition is that the AIRS will incorporate a multidisciplinary approach that has a strong focus on care based in the community, with in-reach into the acute setting facilitating earlier discharge and supporting admission/readmission avoidance. 

The Authority is initially seeking to commission an integrated combined Home Oxygen Service-Assessment and Review (HOS-AR) and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Service that will form the foundation of AIRS. The service will align with the vision of the Fylde Coast Respiratory Transformation Programme and develop into a fully integrated, multi-disciplinary, Adult Integrated Respiratory Service, over a three-year timeframe. The delivery model will focus on prevention, identification and early intervention and on-going management, which for the Fylde Coast population will aim to:

• Reduce their risk of developing respiratory disease
• Ensure equitable access to early and accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases, with early intervention to improve quality of life and slow disease progression.
• Provide high quality, consistent and integrated care for those living with respiratory diseases, with treatments and support provided in a community setting wherever possible.

The service, which will also deliver support for patients who have been diagnosed with post-Covid syndrome, will integrate with existing services e.g. Rapid Response, Respiratory Virtual Ward, to ensure that patients are managed on the most appropriate treatment pathway and that they experience a seamless transition of care.",,,"North West","85100000 ","Helen Graham",mlcsu.tendersnorth@nhs.net,"c/o NHS Lancashire & South Cumbria","Chorley House, Lancashire Business Park",Leyland,"PR26 6TT",England,,www.lancashireandsouthcumbria.icb.nhs.uk,,,"This contract award is for Social and other specific services which are Light Touch Regime services for the purpose of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as specified in Schedule 3 of the Regulations ('Regulations') http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/schedule/3/made

Medicines account for 25% of NHS carbon emissions, 5 percentage points being direct emissions, e.g. from inhalers and anaesthetic gases, and 20% being from other medicines, including those emissions embedded in the medicines supply chain.
Whilst several options exist, it is unclear which methodology is the most practical and usable for the NHS in assessing the carbon footprint of specific medicines, which is essential for determining the next steps in the NHS's strategy to reduce emissions from medicines, particularly those beyond direct emissions from inhalers and anaesthetics. 
The objective of this project is therefore to understand the best approach to assess carbon emissions from specific medicines or groups of medicines (e.g. by class, formulation,  administration route), and then use this to inform the next priority areas for the sustainable medicines programme, as well as recommendations for future monitoring of progress.

Initially, the commissioner was seeking a provider who can deliver MHTRs focussing on Bristol Magistrates Court.

MHTRs form part of the wider Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) Programme which is a partnership between the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I), Public Health England (PHE) and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS).  

The CSTR Programme aims to develop pathways to enable and facilitate the increased use of all three treatment requirements:
-	Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs)
-	Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs)
-	Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATRs)

ATRs and DRRs in Avon were outside the scope of this procurement, beyond the co-ordination of CSTRs for combined orders. However, there is an expectation that MHTR and ATR & DTR providers will work closely together in the best interests of the service user, especially where it can be identified that a combined order is the best outcome.

MHTR in the context of the CSTR programme is intended for the sentencing of individuals convicted of an offence(s) which has crossed the community order sentencing threshold and may be used as an alternative to short custodial sentences for individuals who may have range of mental health, personality disorder and psychological issues/vulnerabilities which do not require forensic or secondary care treatment.

The aims of the service are to:
•	Increase the proportion of offenders with mental health issues for whom an effective mental health treatment plan is in place.
•	Reduce re-offending by addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour. 
•	Prevent custodial sentences (especially short ones), by offering robust community treatment options.
•	Provide tailored mental health support to the most vulnerable offenders. Individuals supported by pilot sites included those who suffered from post-traumatic stress, trauma, bipolar, personality and phobia disorders, psychosis and ASD. 

The contract will be for an initial term of 2 years, with a possible extension of a further one year. 

The substantive/initial financial envelope relates to delivering an indicative volume of 160 MHTRs annually, primarily to Bristol Magistrates Court.

The Commissioner had a maximum financial envelope of £162,500 per annum for this element. 

Services commenced on 01 August 2022.

During the life of the contract, it is likely that the Commissioner will wish to work with the successful provider to 'scale up' the service in order to deliver MHTRs to other Magistrates and Crown Courts across Avon. The additional activity is not guaranteed at this time.

•	Ensure 24/7 access to crisis support and specialist clinical and forensic care/ advice
•	Ensure the workforce has the required capabilities and competencies 
•	Operate as part of a coherent Sexual Assault Pathway
•	Ensure effective collaboration with key partners

Key elements of Dorset SARC services include:

ADHD is a mental health disorder and patients will already be destabilised by the Covid-19 pandemic and it would be not within the interest of the patients to cause more anxiety by destabilising the incumbent provider, nor would it be deemed clinically good practice. The direct award enables recovery from the pandemic and stability for the patient's health conditions, with the intention of procuring the service in the future.

The service contract shall be for a period of 18 months and will commence on the 1 September 2020.The contract value is estimated to be £818,000.00 over the 18 month contract period. The prevailing NHS standard contract terms and conditions shall apply.

The service aims to provide a specialist assessment and diagnostic service to adults with a suspected ADHD and those with a confirmed diagnosis residing in Shropshire, Telford, and Wrekin.

Service objectives:
• To enable adults with suspected ADHD who do not have a diagnosed learning disability to obtain a timely diagnosis of their condition;
• To provide a local, weekly clinic, for the review and ongoing treatment of complex and non-complex patients, to include prescribing and monitoring;
• To signpost people with ADHD to other agencies and sources of support as appropriate;
• To provide guidance on self-help strategies and recommendations for patients in support of self-care;
• To signpost patients with an unconfirmed diagnosis to appropriate services and support networks.

The adult specialist ADHD service shall provide a local assessment and diagnosis service to support people with suspected ADHD and those with a diagnosis of ADHD to include prescribing.

The service shall aim to complete an assessment within 18 weeks of receiving a referral for an individual.

The provider shall be required to undertake shared care in relation to prescribing medication with the patient's GP, where the GPs have signed up to the shared care agreement.

A Voluntary Ex Ante Transparency Notice was previously published to support this contract award - 2020/S 142-350894, detailing the following reasons for direct award: 

• A PIN as a call for competition was issued September 2019, four providers expressed interest and were invited through to the tender stage. During the tender stage only two bids were received and one of the bidders provided written withdrawal. This meant only one suitable tender was received. The procurement was aborted.

• This service is deemed an essential service.The current circumstances within the healthcare environment, Covid-19, could negatively affect patients should change happen now. The incumbent provider Health and Wellbeing Ltd is an SME with the requirement to enter into new lease agreements, therefore the CCG's need to ensure ongoing service stability.",,,"West Midlands","85000000 ","Hayley Smith",h.smith27@nhs.net,"NHS Telford and Wrekin CCG","Halesfield 6, Halesfield",Telford,"TF7 4BF",England,07770493216,,"ADHD VEAT 2020-OJS142-350894-en.pdf ",,"A VEAT Notice was published under the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

These have been provided to the NHS since the 1960s, but in 2017 responsibility was discharged from DHSC to NHS Improvement (now NHS England), within the national NHS Estates and Facilities division.

Producing TSG requires a specialist skill set, including architects, health planners, engineers, technical author and editorial skills. Since 2018 external specialist consultancy support has been procured to provide the necessary resource and expertise so NHS England can progress updates.

The current contract for technical authoring is coming to an end and so NHS England are looking to award a new 4-year contract for the specialist skills required so the TSG Programme can continue.

PHB Support Service organisations will support Adults and Children who have been approved to receive a PHB by NHS Wandsworth CCG or its representatives.

It is estimated that around 20 PHB holders will be available to receive support planning in January 2017. This number is expected to rise significantly in line with NHS England's Mandate to increase the number of PHB holders over the next five years. This equates to a minimum of 760 PHBs for NHS Wandsworth CCG.

The expectation is that the providers that meet the initial Award Criteria and requirement of the Service Specifications for Lot 1, Lot 2 and Lot 3 will be added to the approved list of providers and initially be allocated a contract on a rotation basis of first come first serve. 

It is therefore imperative that approved providers who are added to this framework and have met the Award Criteria are ready to go live in January 2017. 

If a provider cannot be ready by this date, the CCG will then move on to the next capable provider on the accreditation list until the first 20 PHB holders are cared for. 

After the initial rotational allocation as specified above, all contracts will then be chosen by the PHB holder from the list of NHS Wandsworth CCG approved providers who have all passed and met the defined Award Criteria and requirements of the draft Service Specifications for Lot 1, Lot 2 and Lot 3.

NHS Wandsworth CCG welcomes interested parties from all market sectors, including the Third Sector and the contracts will commence during January 2017.

Expressions of interest must be by way of completion and return of the attached Questionnaire by the date and time specified within.

The overall aim of the service is to support the CCGs to improve the quality, safety and cost effective use of medicines in primary care, reduce variation in practice and improve health outcomes for patients. This will be achieved through the implementation of a medicines optimisation action plan, approved by the commissioner and implemented by the provider through the provision of high quality medicines optimisation support to all practices within the boundaries of the CCGs

A fundamental component of the service is that it works in an integrated way with the CCG team, medicines optimisation commissioning support, GPs and GP practice teams to ensure multi-disciplinary working and a patient centred approach to achieve the optimal use of medicines and best outcomes for patients.

The Commissioner wishes to receive responses to the Invitation to Tender (ITT) from suitably qualified and experienced service providers with the necessary capacity and capability (or a demonstrable ability to provide the necessary capacity and capability) to provide the range of services required. 

Current services are approximately valued at £397,000 across the life of a three year contract but commissioners seek financial efficiencies through the tender.

Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans are widely recognised as an efficient way of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) to predict people who are risk of fragility fractures as a result of osteoporosis or thinning bones. Identifying people who are at risk of fractures allows for appropriate interventions to be made. The scans also provide the ‘Gold Standard’ for diagnosing osteoporosis.

The demand for DEXA scans over the last few years has stabilised, although there is a potential for these to increase slightly as people age and particularly amongst post-menopausal women, and predictions for future populations indicate an ageing population.

The aim is to maintain scanning rates to a level which is in line with recognised good practice for the identification and management of osteoporosis, and able to cater for future demand (e.g. ageing population).

Key objectives of the Pennine Lancashire Procurement are to:

•	Provide patients with access to an NHS Community DEXA scan service
•	Ensure patients are seen and treated in a community setting most appropriate to their needs
•	Deliver an integrated model of DEXA service provision for Pennine Lancashire
•	Deliver affordable and value for money NHS Community DEXA scan service

The purpose of the review is to make sure health and care services on the Isle of Wight make best use of available resources and continue to deliver excellence for years to come.  The Isle of Wight Clinical Commissioning Group in partnership with the Isle of Wight Council, the Isle of Wight NHS Trust has appointed a consortium to lead on this work. 

The programme will be underpinned by detailed modelling aligned to in-depth public consultation split into two phases. The first phase – “detailing the case for change” – runs for two months, between March and May 2016. This phase seeks to make the public aware of the challenges facing the Island’s health and care services, as well as the opportunities to reshape them. It invites views on the current state of services and asks the public for any changes they might like to see. 

Alongside this activity, a programme of co-production is being established, looking at a number of priority areas and inviting people to participate in directly helping to reshape service. The outputs of this phase will then inform the development of a formal consultation that will set out specific options to redesign services on the Island, planned for autumn 2016, although this is subject to NHS England assurance processes. 

The WISR project is being carried out through the My Life a Full Life (MLAFL) programme.  MLALF is an NHS England Vanguard site and part of the national New Models of Care programme. It is a collaboration of organisations, including the Isle of Wight Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the Isle of Wight Council (IWC), the Isle of Wight NHS Trust (IWNHS Trust) and One Wight Health (a GP membership organisation), who work in partnership with the voluntary sector to fundamentally change and improve the lives of people on the Island.

This will be a programme that aims to teach young people about the NHS and encourage them to undertake some social action activity to support their local community or the NHS.  The toolkit will be 'open access' meaning that any young people's organisation such as youth clubs, uniformed youth organisations or schools can pick up the module and deliver it with the young people they work with thereby providing the opportunity to influence a wide range of young people from diverse backgrounds.  The provider will develop a suite of resources using different mediums to ensure that the toolkit is accessible to all (i.e., online, paper and face to face) and can support a wide range of youth providers to deliver and support their young people to complete the module.

Young People's Health Challenge aims to teach young people aged 7 -14 about the NHS and encourage them to undertake some social action activity to support the NHS. This is key for the future of our NHS whilst providing young people with valuable skills and aspirations to work or volunteer within the NHS or engage in social action. In addition, educating young people about self-care and appropriate use of NHS services can have an impact on the entire family's use of NHS services and social action is known to provide health and wellbeing benefits to individuals.  Introducing social action at a young age can establish a lifetime of volunteering and social action, thereby providing a protective element to an individual's health and wellbeing. 
 
The NHS People Plan recognises the value of introducing young people into volunteering roles in the NHS with a view to encouraging them to think about a longer-term career in the NHS.  The NHS Long Term plan builds on this encouraging greater access for younger volunteers as part of the commitment to increase diversity of volunteers.

This will be a programme that aims to teach young people about the NHS and encourage them to undertake some social action activity to support their local community or the NHS.  The toolkit will be 'open access' meaning that any young people's organisation such as youth clubs, uniformed youth organisations or schools can pick up the module and deliver it with the young people they work with thereby providing the opportunity to influence a wide range of young people from diverse backgrounds.  The provider will develop a suite of resources using different mediums to ensure that the toolkit is accessible to all (i.e., online, paper and face to face) and can support a wide range of youth providers to deliver and support their young people to complete the module.

Young People's Health Challenge aims to teach young people aged 7 -14 about the NHS and encourage them to undertake some social action activity to support the NHS. This is key for the future of our NHS whilst providing young people with valuable skills and aspirations to work or volunteer within the NHS or engage in social action. In addition, educating young people about self-care and appropriate use of NHS services can have an impact on the entire family's use of NHS services and social action is known to provide health and wellbeing benefits to individuals.  Introducing social action at a young age can establish a lifetime of volunteering and social action, thereby providing a protective element to an individual's health and wellbeing. 
 
The NHS People Plan recognises the value of introducing young people into volunteering roles in the NHS with a view to encouraging them to think about a longer-term career in the NHS.  The NHS Long Term plan builds on this encouraging greater access for younger volunteers as part of the commitment to increase diversity of volunteers. NHS Cadets was established for this purpose, working with 14-18-year olds and is delivered in partnership with St John Ambulance.  At present we have no provision for younger aged children.  This programme builds further on this, working with younger children to start to introduce them to the NHS at a time when they will just be thinking about what they might like to be when they are older.

Optum represent the London Focus Group in the contract negotiation and management (including raising data challenges and disputes) of 16 non-specialist providers in London. The total planned contract values that were managed by Optum in 2018/19 were c£64m. This contract extension will provide short term cover to the CCGs whilst they review the longer term provision of their commissioning support in light of changing national guidance and directives.

Pending clarification at national level of potentially new commissioning arrangements, the Commissioners intend to award a one-year contract extension to the incumbent service provider on grounds of proportionality, technical (specification) and economics. It is considered that:
•	For an extension period of just one year, no provider would be capable of offering a more economically advantageous tender for delivering the specification that has been developed during the course of the current five-year contract;
•	A competitive procurement should be undertaken only if there is clear potential for a material cost saving and benefits outweighing the costs of their generation. In this case the Commissioners consider that there is no such potential, the incumbent provider having (a) demonstrated its competitiveness against other providers through the award of two contracts spanning ten years and (b) having demonstrated acceptable performance throughout that period, generating significant cost savings; 
•	Furthermore, when designing and delivering procurements, the Commissioners are required to have proper regard for the bidding costs providers incur and must seek to avoid wasted costs where the likelihood of a change of provider is deemed very low;
•	The Commissioners' decision to award a contract extension to the incumbent provider without competition is therefore proportionate and appropriate on technical and economic grounds.

Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust are establishing a Dynamic Purchasing System for use by NHS Trusts in Somerset, for the provision of clinical service providers to support waiting list initiatives and ad hoc service capacity issues.  These initiatives tend to be required at short notice for a minimum of 3 months, although some services may be outsourced for a shorter or longer period of time.    

Health providers deliver NHS funded clinical services under the terms of the NHS Standard Contract. It is becoming increasingly common for health providers to sub-contract delivery of certain clinical services to a third party. This subcontracting can take many forms. It can be the sub-contracting of an entire service or of delivery of part of a care pathway. It can be the sub-contracting to one sub-contractor or to multiple sub-contractors.  Information about the NHS Standard contract and Sub contracting can be found at https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-standard-contract/17-18/

Clinical specialities/clinical services may be included, but are not limited to the following clinical services:

Orthopaedic surgery (Joints - hips/knees & hands), Urology, General Surgery, Maxillofacial surgery Ophthalmology, Phacoemulsification cataract extraction and lens implant, Audiology (hearing tests) , Endoscopy, Lithotripsy, Termination of pregnancy, Radiology services (MRI and Cardiac MRI scans, Duplex Scanning). Histopathology reporting. 

Mini competitions will be run from the Dynamic Purchasing System which will reflect the specific clinical service requirements in order to ensure that the sub-contract provider will:
-	meet quality requirements, 
-	meet relevant conditions from  Terms and Conditions of the NHS Standard Contract, 
-	reflect the NHS price for the service 
-	provide assurances that they are capable of delivering the agreed service requirements that have been set
-	comply with any referral protocols.

This is an initial 1 year contract with a maximum value of £2,000,000. These figures include VAT. Please note payment relates to financial years. The Framework, agreed by DHSC, NHS England and NHS Improvement, and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC),  was released in July 2019, and describes how community pharmacy will support delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan. A new NHS Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS), launched in October 2019, forms part of the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework. CPCS will enable patients to be better connected with community pharmacy, allowing delivery of an effective service that is convenient for patients and demonstrates the value of community pharmacy.

HEE is intending to commission continuing professional development (CPD) workshops to drive forward the workforce elements of the Pharmacy Integration Fund and develop and strengthen the role of community pharmacists. The integration of pharmacy professionals into locally delivered care pathways will yield benefits for the patients and the service, resulting in a more responsive and clinically effective NHS primary care patient pathway whilst meeting the public's expectations for a modern NHS community pharmacy service.

The Community Pharmacy Consultation Service (CPCS) Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Workshops will provide the opportunity to enhance community pharmacists' knowledge, skills and confidence to undertake effective patient-facing consultations, assessments and communications as part of the NHS urgent care pathways. The ambition is that pharmacists are valued across all sectors and recognised by patients and the public, and by all professions and industry leaders, for their impact and contribution to healthcare.

The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCWCSU) on behalf of the Commissioners. The procurement was split into four regional lots, detail of which can be found below. 

The aim of the School Aged Immunisation Service is to prevent the eligible population, which is defined as any eligible child attending a school, or not attending a school but registered with a GP and/or resident within the defined geographic boundaries, from developing vaccine preventable childhood diseases that are associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

The following vaccines, which form part of the national childhood immunisation programme, will be commissioned by the service with the purpose of preventing the infections and outbreaks caused by these organisms:
•	diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis (Td/IPV adolescent booster);
•	meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY);
•	human papillomavirus (HPV);
•	seasonal influenza (flu) immunisation programmes for school aged children (the cohort is expected to expand in future years); and 
•	measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) catch-up.

NHS England expects the school aged immunisation service to be delivered primarily in schools. However, the service must be offered to 100% of school aged children, with all reasonable steps taken to engage with children and young people that are home-schooled, from groups that find it difficult to access services, for example gypsy or traveller children, or looked after children who may require special and specific arrangements.

The four lots are:
•	Lot 1: Berkshire
•	Lot 2: Buckinghamshire
•	Lot 3: Oxfordshire
•	Lot 4: Wiltshire

Bidders were able to bid for one, multiple or all lots. There were no limitations to the number of Lots which could have been awarded to any one tenderer.

The contract duration (for all 4 Lots) will be for an initial term of 3 years, with a possible extension period up to a further 12 months, as defined and at the discretion of the Commissioner. 

The expected service commencement date (for all 4 Lots) is the 1st April 2018, with a contract expiry (for all 4 Lots) of the 31st March 2021.  

The contract (for all 4 Lots) will be commissioned on the following fixed tariff:
•	Child influenza vaccine will be paid at £10 (ex VAT) per immunisation administered
•	All other Immunisation covered by this contract will be paid at £14.50 (ex VAT) per immunisation administered.

This work is being taken forward to support the implementation of Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) recommendations aimed at improving clinical quality by delivering revision knee surgery via clinical networks on a regional basis.
The national pricing team have identified funding from tariff to fund networks hosted by Major Revision Centres (MRC), and NHSE/I are piloting this approach initially with two providers.

The second phase will be during 2022/23 when NHSE/I will pilot one additional MRC.

In the South East between April 2017 and March 2020, 2,126 knee revision procedures were carried out. This is an average of 709 per year. NHSE/I estimate there will be around 400 knee revisions in Kent, Surrey and Sussex (KSS) during 2022/23, and so are looking for a third MRC in the KSS area. 

NHSE/I seek Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from providers who would like to be considered as the third MRC pilot. 
The requirements of an MRC pilot are described within the attached service specification.

A two-part funding approach has been developed to support the pilots consisting of a core payment for activity and complexity payment for the MRCs.

a.	Core payment: NHS England Specialised Commissioning will fund to orthopaedic and trauma services for activity based on core national tariff. 

b.	MDT and complexity payment: designated MRC pilots will be paid an up-front block payment of £250k (full year effect) to set up and manage an MDT service for their local network of providers. 

c.	Mobilisation payment: designated MRC pilots will be paid a one-off up-front block payment of £300k. This funding must be spent specifically on the set up and running of the MRC revision knee service to ensure compliance with national published revision knee standards (called BOASTs) and should be directed by a locally appointed Revision Knee Lead.

EOIs received will be used to help NHSE/I finalise their commissioning and contracting approach for this service. 

A briefing event for interested parties and other providers in the networks (i.e. Revision Units and Primary Arthroplasty Units), has been arranged between 1.00pm and 3.00pm on Friday 8th April 2022. Please keep this time free. Further details will be provided prior to the event

The service will support access to dental care for patients through the delivery of NHS dental services.

The aim of the dental service is: 

•	To increase access to dental services for those patients who do not currently have a dentist.
•	To provide Mandatory Dental Services to the cohort of patients who do not currently have a dentist.
•	To improve the oral health of patients treated.
•	The service includes the provision of urgent care and delivery of the CDO initiative 'Starting Well Core'.

The principal aim is to secure services in the following geographic areas. These areas have been identified as the priority areas for access, primarily based on replacing activity which has ceased within this financial year. The UDA rate will be paid at the SW Regional average UDA rate which is £28.91; this UDA rate includes the provision of all services listed within this notification document and as set out above. A percentage of each new contract will be devoted to Starting Well Core, the proportion of which will be agreed for each contract as this may vary dependent upon the local population.

Priority Areas
The geographical areas where activity is prioritised for commissioning are shown in the table attached (Priority Areas.pdf) along with the indicative levels of activity sought.

Dependent upon the level of success in securing services in the above prioritised areas, commissioners will secondarily consider interest in the provision of services to the same specification in other areas within the South West. For those other areas where the additional activity is commissioned outside of the priority areas, the UDA rate will be paid at the SW Regional average UDA rate which is £28.91; this UDA rate includes the provision of all services listed within this notification document and as set out above.

The combined contracts will be awarded up to a total financial envelope of approx. £4.87m per financial year, apportioned across the region and based upon expressions of interest and the application of the commissioner's prioritisation model.

Priority will be given to expressions of interest based on the following criteria: 

•	Firstly, that activity is identified within the locality in which activity has ceased within this financial year.
•	Secondly, areas with lower-than-average access based on the England average over 12 months for children and 24 for adults.

Expressions of Interest
Expressions of Interest received will enable the SW Dental team to finalise their commissioning approach.

Should NHSE/I proceed to a process it may consist of two phases:  

(1)	Phase 1 would entail urgent placement of Units of Dental Activity (UDAs) (which may be temporary or recurrent) in accordance with the prioritisation model, with providers expressing their interest and providing acceptable evidence of their capability and capacity in relation to the service requirements. This evidence may be subject to further assurance and validation by the commissioner, and in this event the commissioner will contact the provider to request further clarification.

(2)	Phase 2 would be a competitive process and involve assessment of bids against published evaluation criteria and weightings. A competitive process may be used, for example, in the following scenarios: 
•	if multiple providers express an interest for particular areas 
•	if expressions of interest exceed the available financial envelope
•	to commission services with a later mobilisation date

This process is being managed by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner(s).

The Review is a partnership between NHSEI and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS), the purpose of which is to improve health and well-being outcomes for women in prison and upon their release, to reduce health inequalities and ensure equity of access to the full range of health and social care services across the women's estate. It will achieve this through a better understanding of the current ability of, and challenges faced by, the women's estate and prison health and social care services in delivering high quality care, treatment, and support of women in prison in England. It is a year long Review which is expected to report early 2022.
The contribution of women in prison and those with lived experience of imprisonment is crucial to ensuring that services are designed to effectively meet their need. Embedding the voice of women in prison into the review programme will allow the views, experiences, and concerns of women in prison to inform the findings and recommendations.
The main objective of the Lived Experience Service will be to ensure women in prison and those with lived experience of imprisonment are aware of the review programme, understand its aims and objectives and can effectively contribute and shape the plans and development of the programme, findings, and recommendations. 
The Service must be independent from the health and social care service provision in the women's prisons to enable the ability to act as an independent and critical friend. 
The provider will be expected to develop and initiate a schedule of gender specific and trauma responsive engagement activities across the women's estate over the life of the review programme and engage directly with women in prison on site as far as practicable within any security/COVID restraints. 

All women's prisons in England are in scope.

The National Women's Prisons Review Programme is a scoping programme. The deliverables are being executed in stages. The schedule for each stage is approved by the programme board (National Women's Prisons Review Group) following successful closure of the previous stage. The provider will therefore be expected to provide a flexible service and schedule to support programme delivery and adapt to changing demands and timelines.  
The Contract is anticipated to commence on 1st June 2021 until 30th November 2021 in line with the timeline for the review programme. The Contract may be extended for any period up to a further six months. This is not guaranteed and will be dependent on several factors including whether the review programme itself is extended within the 6-month timescale tolerance. 
The contract value is £40,000.

Publication or response to this notice does not commit commissioners or respondents to award any contracts or to any future procurement.

The Life Planning service has been commissioned as a direct response to the National Response to Winterbourne View: 
https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/transform-care-nxt-stps.pdf

Building the Right Support, published in October 2015, is a national plan to develop community services and close inpatient facilities for people with learning disabilities and/or autism.  It gives commissioners a clear framework to develop more community services for people with learning disabilities and/ or autism who display behaviours that challenge, including those with a mental health condition, and close some inpatient facilities.

On 28th November 2018 and 17th December 2018, respectively, the Supreme Court handed down its judgments in relation to the following two linked cases: 
1) Secretary of State for Justice (Respondent) v MM (Appellant) [2018] UKSC 60
2) Welsh Ministers v PJ [2018] UKSC 66

There has continued to be concern raised nationally about the impact of these judgments on the ability or otherwise to discharge some patients from hospital into the community, in particular those with learning disabilities, autism, or both. However, the judgment also has the potential to have an impact on the care of patients with mental illness and personality disorder and is a challenge where people who present high-risk behaviours are detained in hospital, have come into the system via the criminal courts and are subject to restrictions under section 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983. 

The NHS long term plan continues to reflect government policy in maintaining a commitment to people with learning disabilities, autism or both, who have a mental illness or whose behaviour challenges services, with a particular focus on reducing the need for long term detention in hospital and meeting their needs wherever possible in the community.

Life Planning is a person-centred approach. Starting with the person and their family, the Life Planner will work with, and listen to those who know them best by helping people to understand the person's story, strengths, interests, skills and hopes for the future. From this both a Life Plan and a Support Plan is developed.  The Life Plan will be deliverable, fit for purpose and detail who the person is, what they like doing, what they are good at, their network of support, how they want to live and who they want to live with (if anyone).  The support plan outlines how a person should be supported to have a safe, meaningful and fulfilling life.",,,"London,South East,South West","85000000 ","Phil Fear",scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"South Plaza,Marlborough Street",,BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home,"Additional information - Life Planning summary and overview.pdf NHSEI Life Planning - Market Engagement Questionnaire.docx NHSE Life Planning Contracts Finder Addendum to Additional Text.docx ","https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/1271 ","Evidence from programmes across the country have shown that a process known as Life Planning (also known as Service Design) is effective at:
•	Engaging a person with a learning disability/autistic spectrum condition in planning for their own futures
•	Bringing together key stakeholders, especially commissioners, providers and the families
•	Developing robust plans with the person in hospital that can be translated into effective support
•	Supporting people to achieve their hopes and dreams whilst remaining safe and well
•	Addressing risk and complexity in innovative ways so that people who have previously challenged services can live well out of hospital.

Life Planning in the context of this notice conforms to the principles described in Keys to Citizenship by Dr Simon Duffy (Paradigm, 2003) An updated guide outlines the key principles and can be found at:
http://www.centreforwelfarereform.org/uploads/attachment/527/citizenship-a-guide-for-providers-of-support.pdf

NHSE South region previously commissioned the delivery of 100 Life Plans during the period September 2017 to June 2019.  It is anticipated that a future recommissioning of Life Planning services will take place after 1st April 2021, to deliver Life Plans for people in placements that are currently commissioned by NHSEI South East region (secure hospital and children's specialist inpatient services).
  
The primary outcomes of the service include:

•	Agreed number of Life Plans delivered within an agreed timescale after commencement of the contract
•	Clear evidence of robust involvement of the person in hospital in developing the plan, along with their family
•	Create links between commissioners, providers, families and the person with whom the plan is being developed
•	Clear evidence that Life Plans are leading to sustained, safe discharges
•	A net reduction in the number of people in secure hospital settings

At this time, commissioners would like to determine the potential level of provider interest and are seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) from providers who have the capability and capacity to undertake such a contract (and would wish to take to part in a potential procurement exercise).

To express an interest in potentially delivering these services in future, please register on the In-Tend portal at this address https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/ProjectManage/1271 and submit a completed Market Engagement Questionnaire by 12pm on Friday 26th February 2021.

The purpose of the SAS is
-	 to ensure the provision of Primary Medical Services for patients who have been subject to immediate removal from a practice list of a primary medical services contractor because of an act or threat of violence.  (Age 16+)
-	to provide a stable environment for the patient to receive continued health care. 
-	to address any underlying causes of aggressive behaviour by promoting a continuing understanding of the NHS health and social care system to encourage the patient to use the service. 
-	To return patients to mainstream primary medical care services when it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so. 

There are currently 100 patients registered across the area. These figures fluctuate due to the nature of the patient cohort and the ultimate intention to return patients to mainstream general practice where appropriate.

In our new service we are looking for:
-	A Greater say in where services are located, based on areas of highest need, and tackling health inequalities
-	A new way of working which prioritises population health management, personalisation of care, and rewards delivering patient outcomes
-	Flexibility of service delivery  for providers to work with partners in primary care, commissioning, secondary care and non medical services to innovate and improve quality.

The Commissioner may then choose to proceed directly to a procurement process with parties who have responded to the notice and there shall be no further notice published.

NHS England and NHS Improvement South East (NHSE/I) seeks Expressions of Interest (EOI) from providers who have the capability and capacity to deliver adult eating disorder in-patient services in the South East region*. 

These services are not currently available within the South East region, meaning that people from the South East who require an adult eating disorder admission are frequently required to travel long distances from home. This is particularly challenging during the COVID pandemic due to the restrictions on travel within and across regions. 

The contract term is likely to be 1 year, with the option to extend for a further 1 year at the commissioner's discretion. The expectation is that 8 beds will be required. 

The anticipated contract value is in the region of £2,000,000.00 for 8 beds, per year; further information in relation to finance will be confirmed later.

Currently the South East has to access adult eating disorder beds commissioned from services outside of the South East. NHSE/I's aspiration is to establish safe, effective and timely access to services within the South East on or before 1st April 2021. 
As such, only organisations with appropriate experience, capability and capacity to mobilise quickly should respond to this notice. For the avoidance of doubt, capacity relates to staffing, premises, beds, appropriate systems and any other resources required to enable delivery of these services. 

New services will need to demonstrate willingness to work with emerging South East AED provider collaboratives or systems.

A copy of the current national service specification is provided (on In-Tend). Please note that changes to the national programme are anticipated during, or immediately following the term of this contract, and therefore providers will be expected to work with commissioners to support implementation of required changes and adjust service delivery in a safe and timely manner, if required.  
Additionally the future provision of adult eating disorder services will be informed via the outcomes of the Adult Eating Disorders National Demand and Capacity Review which has recently commenced and will help determine next steps. The provider will also be required to meet the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Standards for Adult Inpatient Eating Disorder Services (provided on In-Tend).

Expressions of interest must be received by 12pm on Monday 11th January 2021. 

EOIs received will be used to help NHSE/I finalise their commissioning and contracting approach for these services.

This exercise is being carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit on behalf of NHSE/I. 

NHS England/Improvement South East is experiencing a significant latent surge in demand for eating disorder inpatient beds. Community teams are reporting that patients are presenting with higher levels of acuity and frequently require stabilisation in acute hospitals before accessing the appropriate inpatient AED beds.  Community teams also report a lack of timely bed availability for patients who have been assessed to meet the threshold for specialised eating disorder in-patient care.  NHSE/I SE are working with national leads to inform the demand and capacity review of AED. In the interim period NHSE/I SE would like to commission 8 beds to address the unmet need and high levels of acuity for this highly vulnerable patient cohort.

This is particularly challenging during the COVID pandemic with the restrictions on travel within and across regions.   

In light of the significant unmet need and surge in demand for inpatient adult eating disorder beds across the South East, NHSE/I are seeking expressions of interest from providers with the appropriate expertise, capacity and capability to provide rapid access to 8 adult eating disorder beds in the South East region.  

The contract duration is 1 year with the option to extend for a further 1 year at the commissioner's discretion. 

The anticipated contract value is in the region of £2,000,000.00 per annum and therefore up to a maximum anticipated value of £4,000,000.00 if the extension option was to be enacted.

NHS South of England Procurement Services (SoEPS), acting on behalf of Health Education England (the Commissioner) is commencing a tender for the provision of e-portfolios for NHS Dental Foundation Training and Dental Core Training.

Both NHS Dental training programmes are currently using (different) e-portfolios. Through this procurement we intend to unite the programmes and their approximately 2,000 trainees (plus trainers and administrators) onto one e-portfolio platform that fits our specification as closely as
possible. As this procurement is for an off-the-shelf e-portfolio system rather than a bespoke commission, we fully appreciate that not all of our high priority requirements may be available in one system and that there will inevitably need to be an element of compromise involved in the selection and implementation of the system. Nonetheless, we intend to be guided in our decision-making by the extent to which systems can meet our highest priority user needs.

The maximum value of this contract is £249,000. This figure is exclusive of any applicable VAT.

HEE would like to invite potential service providers to respond to this Invitation to Tender (ITT) for the provision as set out in the service specification and this document sets out the requirements and the criteria to be used in the evaluation.

Urgent Care 
Provision of a High Intensity User Service (Reference: NHS/SOEPS/21.825 ITT)
NHS Brighton and Hove Clinical Commissioning Group
NHS East Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group

The Commissioner is seeking bids from suitably qualified Providers for provision of a High Intensity User Service, offering patients with high attendance at Emergency Departments psychosocial support, crisis planning, sign-posting in the community and support to use more appropriate services for their psychosocial needs. The service is to be situated in both Brighton and Hove and East Sussex and delivered under the standard NHS Contract. The anticipated value of the Service is a maximum of £343,952.00 per annum and the contract duration will be 3 years from 28th September 2022, plus an optional (option of the Commissioner) extension period of up to a further 24 months.

Key Aims and Objectives of the Service
The High Intensity User Service (HIUS) is based on the 'Blackpool model' developed by Blackpool CCG, as published in the Commissioning for Value Casebook, February 2015.  
The model offers a robust way of reducing HIU activity to EDs, 999, NHS 111, Primary Care services as well as unscheduled hospital admissions. The HIU service liberates front line resources to focus on those who need it most and helps reduce costs.  
The objective of the service is to work closely with identified frequent users of emergency urgent departments, with an aim to reduce unheralded attendances at ED and associated non-elective (NEL) admissions, whilst improving the service user's quality of life and outcomes.  
This will be delivered by:
•	Identifying patients who frequently attend ED and associated non-elective (NEL) admissions
•	Identifying patients who are evidentially on a trajectory to becoming a high intensity user of emergency services
•	Proactively connecting and engaging with the patient
•	Supporting the patient to manage their needs using a personalised approach.

The programme commences on 30th September 2021.  93 NHS organisations have applied to take part, with some working across a complete ICS.

Our aim with this programme is to draw on the collective knowledge and experience of NHSE&I and Timewise to provide NHS organisations with a step-by-step programme to create their own local action plan to deliver more flexible working opportunities in all roles, meeting the People Plan commitments. 

We wish to procure a further evaluation, by an independent organisation, focusing on the value for money in terms of the impact of the programme particularly in supporting organisations to address the changes needed to engage with and improve access to flexible working including: 
•	How would they rate their progress as an organisation at achieving the change they need to fully support the commitments to flexible working in the People Plan?
•	Did they achieve the outcomes identified above in the information about the programme
•	What was particularly useful about the programme / what was less useful?
•	Were the experiences/ outcomes of those attending as an ICS different from those of individual organisations and what learning is there about this for future cohorts and the design of the programme?
•	Do the organisations feel that they would have got to the point they are at with flexible working in their organisation without being part of this programme? Why? Why not?
•	What did they value about the programme and how could the programme could be improved? This needs to include the taught programme sessions, the materials provided, the drop-ins and the overall structure in the context of the support it provided to change teams on the ground
•	What advice would they give to future cohorts?
•	What recommendations can be drawn from the evaluation in order to support organisations and ensure value for money for NHS England & NHS Improvement and the NHS?

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need of establishing a suitable health and wellbeing offer for all our staff.  As a result, we have operated a 24/7 national text helpline since April 2020, to support our NHS staff who are under enormous pressure every day. 

Common themes have emerged in the past year and we want to continue supporting our staff with the below, but are not limited to:
•	COVID-19 
•	Anxiety/Stress 
•	Depression/Sadness 
•	Isolation/Loneliness 
•	Relationships 
•	Suicide 

The requirement is for an SMS based helpline, to continue to provide a psychological support offer for all NHS staff. This service will be provided for all staff during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.

The text service will offer NHS staff the opportunity to converse with trained crisis support workers, and if required will have access to qualified clinical support where needed. The requirement will be to run a 24/7 service, that can operate nationally, and is able to cater to all age groups and demographics. A 24/7 service is essential, crisis support late at night is a key requirement.

Additionally, the supplier should be able to provide anonymized and vital data, to the commissioning organisation, based on text conversations, in order to provide further understanding of emerging concerns and issues related to mental health among our workforce. Finally, the supplier should be able to provide some expertise in supporting communications and marketing, to raise awareness of the helpline. 

Description of Deliverables
-	24/7 SMS based crisis helpline, able to be setup and delivered nationally, to all ages of NHS staff, with clinical oversight, providing immediate (in the moment), anonymous and confidential support for any NHS staff member requiring mental health or crisis support at any time
-	Regular service data and statistics reporting, including identifying current/emerging themes on the helpline
-	Regular service review meetings with commissioning organisation to support delivery of the service
-	Regular marketing consultancy support
-	Marketing content packages to promote the helpline
-	Agreement to work with NHS England and Improvement on any deep dive or evaluation activities relating to the helpline


Pre-market Engagement
NHS England & Improvement are currently undertaking an options appraisal and as part of this have issued a Notice to the market to gauge supplier interest and capability in relation to delivering this service.

Current thinking is that NHS England & Improvement will enter into a 1-year contract with an approximate total value of £90,000 exclusive of applicable VAT.

NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) is working on behalf of NHS Halton CCG for a GP Access Fund for patients living in the Borough.

NHS England has introduced a new initiative called ""GP Access Fund"" with the aim that no patient should have to attend A&E as a walk-in patient as a result of being unable to get an appointment with a GP. NHS Halton CCG is looking for a provider of Primary Care services as part of NHS England's initiative. NHS England have developed 7 core national requirements for the delivery of the Access Fund in order to bring parity to the Access Fund offer across the country and these requirements are:

• Timing of Appointments
• Capacity
• Measurement
• Advertising and ease of access
• Digital
• Inequalities
• Effective Access to wider whole-system services

This service will be accessible by all of the patients of the 14 GP practices that are covered by NHS Halton CCG. The GP Access Fund Services will improve access and experience for patients by providing additional capacity for pre-bookable and also urgent on the day appointments, which are more convenient for patients and offer shorter waits, both during and outside traditional general practice hours. These appointments will be evening appointments from Monday to Friday between the hours of 18:30 and 21:00 and also during Saturdays and Sundays from 09:00 to 15:00.

Potential suppliers should be aware that clarifications to the documents should be submitted before 12pm on Friday 17th August 2018 and Selection Questionnaires should be submitted before 12pm on Friday 24th August 2018.

There will be an initial contract period of 1 year commencing on 1st April 2019.  There will be the option to extend for a further 1-year period. The contract value is set at £1.444M over the entire 2-year contract period.

Submission of the Selection Questionnaire and procurement specific information: this exercise will be conducted on the Midlands and Lancashire CSU portal at https://mlcsu.bravosolution.co.uk

The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

The 8,800 UDAs are expected to provide dental services for approximately 4000 patients (based on the NHS England South West average of 2.2 UDAs per patient). 

The UDAs will be offered at a fixed price of £25.00 per UDA, which is non-negotiable.

There was an opportunity for any successful provider to operate the service from within an existing NHS property based at Southmead Health Centre, Ullswater Road, BRISTOL, Avon, BS10 6DF. Should providers have wished to operate the service from alternative premises, this had to be located within a 2 kilometre radius of BS10 6DF. 

The Commissioner will be contracting for the Services using the standard Personal Dental Services (PDS) Agreement. The Contract is offered for a 2 year period which is anticipated to commence on 1st July 2018*.

It was expected that any successful provider would be able to immediately accept new patients from contract commencement, and provide continuity of NHS dental care for those patients that have been displaced following the termination of the current service. 

The successful bidder will also be required to work closely with the NHS England Commissioning Team in order to co-ordinate and promote patient access.

Market Engagement Event for Extended Access to General Practice Services for NHS South Warwickshire Clinical Commissioning Group. 

NHS Arden & Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit (AGCSU) on behalf of the commissioner(s), NHS South Warwickshire Clinical Commissioning Group (SWCCG), would like to invite providers to attend a 'Market Engagement Event' which will inform the market of the commissioners intentions to procure an 'Extended Access Service', as well as commencing a process to allow the market to feedback on SWCCG's commissioning intentions and requirements, and to gauge market interest. 

The General Practice Forward View (https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gpfv.pdf) published in April 2016 set out plans to enable all Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to commission and fund additional capacity across England to ensure that, by 2020, everyone has improved access to general practice services including sufficient pre-bookable and same day appointments during weekday evenings (after 6.30pm) and at weekends to meet locally determined demand, alongside effective access to out of hours and urgent care services.

The NHS Shared Planning Guidance for the period 2017-2019 (https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NHS-operational-planning-guidance-201617-201819.pdf) published in September 2016 confirmed the requirement for all CCGs to extend and improve access to general practice services by no later than March 2019.  In order for the CCG to qualify to receive the additional recurrent funding identified in the Shared Planning Guidance, the new Extended Access Service must deliver the 7 core criteria outlined on pages 53-54 of the Planning Guidance. 

To date SWCCG has identified the following as some of the key attributes of an Extended Access Service:

•	Integration with other providers in order to maximise the use of existing infrastructure, minimise set up costs and ensure that opportunities to take collaborative approaches are exploited;
•	Provision of routine (pre-bookable) and urgent (same day) appointments for all patients registered with an SWCCG Member Practice (34 practices in total) during weekday evenings (after 6.30pm) and at weekends (Saturdays and Sundays);
•	Direct booking available to all SWCCG Member Practices, NHS 111 and the Out of Hours service provider (other organisations may be added);
•	A range of services to meet the needs of the local population;
•	A range of appointment types and clinical staffing (not all appointments need to be GP face to face consultations);
•	Ease of access for patients;
•	Being operational 365 days a year.",,,"West Midlands","85000000 ","Camilla Ball",SouthProcurement@ardengemcsu.nhs.uk,"NHS AGCSU, St John's House",,Leicester,"LE1 6NB",England,,,"Market Engagement Event Advert - SWCCG Extended Access FINAL V1 21.12.17.pdf ",,"It is expected that the new service will deliver a range of outcomes including:

•	Reduced numbers of patients with a 'primary care appropriate presentation' being seen in Accident & Emergency and the Out of Hours service;
•	A more resilient local health and care system.

The Market Engagement Event will take place during the morning of Tuesday 30th January 2018 in Warwick.  The Event will provide:

•	An overview of the service to be provided;
•	An overview of the CCGs requirements and aims for the service;
•	Stakeholder feedback received so far;
•	Specific questions for attendees to feedback on regarding service delivery;
•	An opportunity to provide feedback on the anticipated service.

NHS England wishes to appoint a suitably qualified provider, in the field of NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC). The contract will provide a national advice and information service for patients who are undergoing assessment, or have been assessed, for NHS CHC. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are the responsible bodies delivering NHS CHC to individuals, in accordance with the Department of Health's  National Framework for NHS CHC (including the Operating Model). A core component of the Operating Model is to provide consistency and improve the individual and family experience of NHS CHC.

• 38,000 visits to the information on the website;
• 2,200 comprehensive written guides sent out to individuals;
• 8,500 telephone consultations; and
• 1,400 written consultations (web portal and email).

BACKGROUND
In-depth, regular, and independent reviews of leadership and governance are good practice across all industries. Rather than solely assessing the current position of providers in the NHS against the well-led framework, these reviews should identify the areas of leadership and governance of organisations that would benefit from further targeted development work to secure and sustain future improvement.                  

Independent and objective assessment as part of these reviews is vital to safeguard against the optimism bias and group think to which even the best organisations may be susceptible. Our guidance therefore recommends that trusts commission an external supplier to coordinate and facilitate the reviews every 3 - 5 years.  Please see the framework guidance for more details: 
LINK https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/well-led-framework/                                                     

Reviews are likely to take the form of commissioning consultancy firms with expertise across the eight domains of the new well-led framework, published in June 2017.  Assuming an even spread of reviews across the suggested period, there may be c.50 reviews commissioned by individual trusts per year.  

INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE                                                   
As part of increasing the value derived from these reviews, and enhancing the knowledge sharing between providers across the NHS, we are establishing a system of peer review to support trusts in their development and preparing new guidance to promote better practice in commissioning suppliers. 

We would like to explore the questions that arise from this approach to developmental well-led reviews with a range of potential suppliers.  As a supplier, this would give you the opportunity to consider your offering to providers in the NHS in the future, consistent with the new well-led framework and the approach to peer review.

ENGAGEMENT EVENT: 
We are holding a market engagement event to discuss the questions attached to this notice. This will take place in the afternoon on WEDNESDAY 12 JULY 2017 in London. A dial in facility will be available, but in person attendance would be preferred. 

If you would like to attend, please email the names of your delegates (maximum 2 per organisation) to v.partridge@nhs.net BY 5pm on THURSDAY 6 JULY 2017; further details of the meeting will be sent to those who respond by this date.

The two key areas for comment are in relation to:
•	Developing new guidance that promotes better practice in commissioning suppliers to deliver effective developmental well-led reviews
•	Embedding peer review as part of the external teams to enable the sharing of experience more widely in the NHS Trust sector.

QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED AT EVENT
In particular, we would like to explore the following questions regarding developmental well-led reviews:
•	What can providers in the NHS do to improve commissioning of reviews leading to improved products that will enhance supplier take-up as well as leading to lasting improvement in the NHS provider sector?  

•	What issues within specifications make it easier for suppliers to deliver an appropriate service; what has been less helpful? 

•	What is your appetite for working with peer reviewers from the NHS? 

•	How would you need to adapt your approach to make use of peer input? 

•	What needs to be considered before peer reviewers can be engaged, e.g. regarding the management of liabilities? 

•	In what ways could we harness the learning from suppliers undertaking multiple reviews?",,,23/02/2018,NO,,,,No,,0,,,,,,,," ",

Estimates suggest that there are a further 8,000 people who may be as yet undiagnosed. Currently about 80% of people invited attend for screening.

The successful bidder will be required to deliver a screening programme which is fully compliant with all relevant national standards and pathways and which include the following elements:

•	Identification and invitation of the eligible diabetic population for screening at regular/appropriate  intervals (i.e. call/recall) in accordance with national guidance;
•	Taking and grading of digital images of service users’ eyes;
•	Provision of Digital Surveillance Clinics, clinics with Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy (SLB) assessments within the commissioned service in accordance with national guidance;
•	Referral of service users to appropriate Hospital Eye Services/Treatment Services in accordance with nationally agreed protocols and treatment pathways.

The population served by the programme will be those covered by the following 6 CCGs: NHS East Surrey, NHS Guildford and Waverley, NHS North East Hampshire and Farnham (Farnham area only), NHS North West Surrey, NHS Surrey Heath and NHS Surrey Downs.

Whilst there are no specific changes to the geographic footprint and population covered by this service anticipated at this point, the provider must be prepared to work with commissioners to implement any such alterations that do arise due to developments during the life of the contract.

Following this feasibility phase NHS England may choose to take forward a procurement.
A digital prevention programme would be separate from the current NHS DPP procurement which is based on the current evidence base for face to face interventions.
We recognise that the NHS DPP will not be suitable for all and that the intensity of time commitment required on the diabetes prevention programme may limit access in certain groups (e.g. working age people / rural communities).
As such, a digital prevention programme could potentially provide an opportunity to expand access to a wider audience in a cost-effective way.
We are keen to run an open discussion workshop with providers / developers of digital behaviour change propositions and would be particularly interested with companies that have an interest in diabetes (both prevention and structured education).
We recognise that the evidence base for effectiveness of digitally delivered behaviour change is currently limited, as part of the discussion we would be particularly interested in understanding:
— Evidence on the effectiveness of digital approaches to support behaviour change;
— The demographic of individuals that would be most likely to access services through digital channels;
— How digital channels could compliment face to face services or be used as viable alternative to face to face provision;
— How outcomes including weight and blood glucose could be accurately monitored and reported as part of a digital intervention;
— How digital approaches could be implemented and scaled.

These include prosthetics and mental health services.

In the Spring 2015 Budget, the Chancellor made available to the NHS in England additional monies for veterans mental health services to support the most vulnerable in the community.

The Forces in Mind Trust has recently undertaken research into veterans’ health needs; this has identified a number of gaps in service. NHS England is seeking Bidders to develop and pilot mental health services to address these identified gaps.

These pilot service contracts are split into 3 Lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Joint Substance Misuse and Mental Health Pilot for Veterans
Lot 2 - Severe PTSD Outpatient Service Pilot
Lot 3 - Overcoming Barriers to Mental Health Service Access for Early Service Leavers

NHS England (the Contracting Authority) expects each Contract to start before 31st October 2015 and they will run until 31st March 2016.

Each Contract/Lot will have a maximum permissible contract value of £400,000 (Ex VAT).

Bidders will not be limited in how many Lots they are able to bid for and the Contracting Authority may award multiple Lots to one Bidder (where Bidders express an interest in being awarded multiple Lots).

In light of the short term nature of the pilot contracts, the challenging timescales for mobilisation and service delivery and given the nature of the services themselves, the Contracting Authority has stipulated the following mandatory criteria for this procurement:

1) Voluntary Sector involvement - It is a mandatory requirement for Bidders to include a form of voluntary sector involvement in their service delivery proposals (see Section A questions for further details). The Authority will accept various forms of relationships including, but not limited to, Bidders who propose to subcontract services to, form a partnership with, or enter into a joint venture with, one or more charity organisations in the support of the delivery of the Services. 

2) Mental Health service providers – It is a mandatory requirement that a current provider of NHS-commissioned Mental Health services is involved in the service delivery alongside the successful provider in some capacity (i.e. as the Lead Bidder or a significant subcontractor) due to the knowledge, experience and other value that such providers would bring to these challenging, short-term pilot contracts.

The procurement process will adopt the “Open Procedure” as a template in that no formal Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) process will be followed. The ITT will be split into stages and the ITT pack contains Eligibility questions which Bidders must pass in order for their ITT bids to be progressed to the evaluation stage. See the ITT documentation for further details.

NHS England has delegated its commissioning authority to NHS Coventry & Rugby CCG and NHS Warwickshire North CCG, and as a result under delegated functions NHS Coventry & Rugby CCG and NHS Warwickshire North CCG will act on behalf of NHS England & NHS Improvement - Midlands 

The Commissioners are looking to re-procure primary medical care services that are currently delivered through time limited APMS contracts which will expire on the 31st March 2020. 

The provision of the services will enable the Commissioners to maintain access to good quality primary medical care for their populations. Improving patient outcomes are focal points of the procurement of healthcare services within NHS Coventry & Rugby CCG & NHS Warwickshire North CCG. In line with the national strategy, the Commissioners intend to work with  primary care providers to mobilise a new model of pro-active preventative care, develop an urgent care offer that provides a coherent, streamlined locally accessible and convenient alternative to accident and emergency services for patients that do not require hospital care and to equip the workforce to deliver excellent patient centred care, whilst recognising the geographical spread of the contracts and the emerging importance of Primary Care Networks.   The Commissioners are looking to appoint Providers that wish to engage fully in this agenda.

NHS Commercial Solutions (NHS CS) is leading this procurement project on behalf of NHS CPP. 
The intricacies of managing activity in contracts let under these frameworks, in particular, have identified the need for a means of managing the flow of equipment and consumable stocks throughout the organisation. To meet this need NHS Commercial Solutions, on behalf of NHS CPP, is procuring a framework agreement for the provision of commercial, ""off-the-shelf"", vendor-neutral inventory management systems to which a number of suppliers will be appointed.
The systems will, inter alia, require the capability to
	interface securely with existing and future trust systems, including Purchase-to-Pay (P2P), e-Sourcing, catalogue and materials management systems and patient administration systems;
	manage the inventory of multiple suppliers, including consignment stock, and the management of items that may be returned to stock after use/sterilisation;
	offer approved suppliers access to appropriate parts of the system to allow inventory to be managed in real time;
	track assets/products by location, linked to a specific patient, in ward or theatre; and
	support patient-level costing and business analytics.
Whilst the initial driver for this project is the implementation, into acute trusts, of TOS and TCS, benefits of inventory management are recognised across the wider NHS, including mental and community health.

The NHS GP Induction and Refresher (I&R Scheme) Scheme provides a safe, supported and direct route for qualified GPs to join or return to NHS general practice.

It is designed for GPs who have previously been on the GMC Register and NHS England's Medical Performers List (NMPL) and would like to return to general practice after a career break, raising a family or time spent working abroad.

The scheme also supports the safe introduction of overseas GPs who have qualified outside the UK and have no previous NHS experience.

All GPs are required to be on NHS England's NMPL before they can practise. The I&R scheme must be completed before GPs can be approved for full inclusion on to the NMPL as an independent general practitioner. GPs not currently working in general practice can apply to return to the NMPL for up to two years after which they will need to apply to join again and complete the I&R Scheme.

A revised Induction and Refresher scheme was launched in March 2015 to enable doctors who hold a recognised qualification in general practice and GMC registration to begin or return to practice as a GP. It is aimed at GPs who have qualified overseas and not worked in the NHS before (induction) and those who have worked as a NHS GP before but been away for over two years or more (refresher).

Scope of Evaluation

The review should look at the application process, MCQ assessments, simulated surgery and the workplace based assessment (WPBA) and suggest potential changes to improve efficiency, equity and transparency with regard to process; comments about validity, reproducibility and appropriateness of the assessments would also be useful. A full psychometric analysis is not however required.

HEE would like answers to the following questions:

•	Is the current programme of assessment fit for the purpose?
•	Are the current standards appropriate to ensure patient safety and patient -centred practice, particularly with regard to patient safety during the placement period?
•	Does the programme avoid ""setting up doctors to fail"" in complex environments through assumptions that they have sufficient basic medical knowledge as well as awareness of NHS systems and ethos?
•	Are there adequate ""educational prescriptions"" which include qualitative feedback and support for communication skills?
•	Are levels of challenge appropriate?
•	Is fairness to candidates sufficiently considered at all stages of test design and delivery?
•	Are enhancements to test development, standard setting and quality assurance methodologies needed currently?
•	Are there emerging evidence-based assessment methodologies that we should consider ensuring that the processes in place remain fit for purpose and adaptable?

NHS continuing healthcare means a package of ongoing care that is arranged and funded solely by the NHS where the individual has been found to have a 'primary health need' as set out in the National Guidance (DH revised 2012). Such care is provided to an individual aged 18 or over, to meet needs that have arisen as a result of disability, accident or illness. The services provided as part of the package should be seen in the wider context of best practice and service development for each client group. Eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare places no limits on the settings in which the package of support can be offered or on the type of service delivery.

The CCGs believe that an integrated CHC model, more so than other contractual vehicle, has the potential to:
•	Enable the reallocation of investment across complex care pathways to services that deliver the greatest value (cost and outcome) to service users and the system as a whole;
•	Incentivise the delivery partner to co-ordinate services around the needs of service users; and
•	Support collaboration with and between other providers involved in the delivery of services
•	Offer an embedded early intervention, case finding and case management service
•	Make best use of existing NHS provision prior to CHC eligibility determination, or in partnership with CHC funding make best use of all resources in the management of long term needs.

Healthwatch is an independent national champion for people who use health and social care services.

There is a local Healthwatch is every area of England.  Healthwatch has a purpose of speaking to people to gather views and understand what they think of local services, and Healthwatch then shares this information with those in charge of local health and care services.  Local Healthwatch also share people's experiences with Healthwatch England, so that issues affecting people across the country can be identified and inform wider changes to services.

The National Health Service (NHS) works hard to treat everyone properly and promptly.  Most people using the NHS are happy with their treatment, but sometimes things can go wrong.  By people raising concerns they help put things right for others and the NHS can learn from experiences.

It currently holds a contract for a community dermatology service, which ends in early 2016, and commissions local hospital dermatology care from the Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. 

The NHS WCCG is keen to consider the different possible ways it may commission community dermatology care. Specifically it wishes service providers to submit suggestions of how a community dermatology service may: 

Provide specialist advice - to 40 General Practices - on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatological conditions for adults and children;

Use technology to provide specialist advice to General Practices, and to undertake clinical assessments;

Work with primary and secondary care to treat conditions such as skin lesions, eczema, psoriasis and acne, in adults and children;

Provide training and educational opportunities for General Practices on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatological conditions;

Inform what referrals from General Practices should be directed to a secondary care hospital provider; and,

Work with the local secondary care hospital provider to ensure it has rapid access to hospital-based interventions, such as light treatment and patch-testing.

The NHS WCCG would ask that it receives any suggestions by no later than the 19th September 2015.

MHTRs form part of the wider Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) Programme which is a partnership between the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHSE/I, Public Health England (PHE) and Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS).

The CSTR Programme aims to develop pathways to enable and facilitate the increased use of all three treatment requirements:
-	Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs)
-	Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs)
-	Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATRs)

ATRs and DRRs in the South East are outside the scope of this procurement, beyond the co-ordination of CSTRs for combined orders. However, there is an expectation that MHTR and ATR & DTR providers will work closely together in the best interests of the service user, especially where it can be identified that a combined order is the best outcome.

MHTR in the context of the CSTR programme is intended for the sentencing of individuals convicted of an offence(s) which has crossed the community order sentencing threshold and may be used as an alternative to short custodial sentences for individuals who may have range of mental health, personality disorder and psychological issues/vulnerabilities which do not require forensic or secondary care treatment.

The precise scope is to be confirmed, but is likely to include:
•	Southampton Magistrates' Court & Portsmouth Magistrates' Court (Hampshire)
•	High Wycombe Magistrates' Court (Buckinghamshire)
•	Guildford Magistrates' Court (Surrey)
•	Brighton Magistrates' Court (East Sussex)

Consideration is being given to the potential lotting strategy, with the outcomes of market engagement being used to inform the final decision.

NHS England and NHS Improvement South East (NHSE/I) and the Offices of the Police and Crime Commissioners and Police Forces as co-commissioners, seeks Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from providers who have the capability and capacity to deliver Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) provision. Commissioners are determining the scope of the delivery model(s) in respect of both adults and paediatric provision and wish to seek views from providers to inform delivery options.
The areas covered within the re-commissioning exercise, and current provision is outlined below:
• Kent (one all age SARC in Maidstone, with a separate contract for paediatricians)
• Surrey (one all age SARC in Cobham, with a separate contract for paediatricians)
• Sussex (one adult SARC in Crawley and one paediatric SARC in Brighton, two separate contracts)
• Hampshire (one all age SARC in Cosham, with separate contracts for paediatricians)

There is considerable variation in service provision across the SARCs, not only with regards to the age and needs of service users but also to activity, service specifications and referral pathways.

This recommissioning exercise will include core SARC provision, namely, the facilities, SARC management, crisis workers and staffing to undertake forensic medical examinations (forensic physicians, nurses).

NHS England, Office of Police & Crime Commissioners and Police Forces within the South are looking to re-commission Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) provision for both adults and paediatrics, including Sexual Offence Examiners / Forensic Medical Examiners.
The areas covered within the re-commissioning exercise include:
• Dorset 
• Hampshire
• Kent 
• Surrey
• Sussex 

There is considerable variation in service provision across the SARCs, not only with regards to the age and needs of service users but also to activity, service specification, referral pathways and the scope of Independent Sexual Violence Adviser (ISVA) and therapeutic / counselling services.

Please note, for Dorset, therapeutic services are out of scope (these are commissioned separately). With regards to ISVA provision, this is also likely to be out of scope and commissioned separately.

For all other SARCs, at this stage, it is unknown as to whether therapeutic services and ISVA provision will be in or out of scope.

The re-commissioning exercise will aim to increase equity of access and ensure a consistent and high standard of quality care to victims of sexual assault in line with the Strategic Direction for Sexual Assault and Abuse Services (2018).

At this time, NHS England would like to determine the level of provider interest from all sectors (including voluntary and third sector) in preparation for hosting provider engagement workshop events in October 2019.

Two events are being held (purely to assist with access and attendance from providers across the geography). Both will address the procurement across Hampshire, Dorset and Kent, Surrey, Sussex and will be similar in format . 

The first event on 25th October will be held in Winchester. The second event on 31st October will be held in either Tonbridge or Gatwick. Providers may choose to attend one or both events. 

We welcome attendance from providers who may be interested in bidding for these services, either in their own right or as a subcontractor or partner, to assist the Commissioners to achieve a better understanding of the provider market. It will be an opportunity to meet with the Commissioners, and discuss the critical issues, challenges and opportunities that relate to future commissioning and provision of SARC services. 

At this stage only high level information, in respect to current services or the future procurement strategy / process will be given. The focus will be on obtaining feedback from the market to help inform the re-commissioning and procurement of these services. 

The procurement is likely to commence in February/March 2020 and will be undertaken by South Central and West Commissioning Support Unit Procurement Team. At this stage, there is likely to be one procurement, lotted appropriately, however this could be subject to change.",,,"South East,South West","85000000 ","Alexandra Searle",Alexandra.searle@nhs.net,"South Plaza,Marlborough Street",,BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home,"Early Engagement Questionnaire - SARCs.docx ","https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/strategic-direction-sexual-assault-and-abuse-services.pdf ","If you are interested in attending an event, please register an expression of interest on the In-Tend e-procurement portal, as well as completing the Engagement Event Questionnaire, by 12 midday on Wednesday 16th October 2019.

In the meantime the CCGs have commenced preparations for, and will undertake, a full competitive tender exercise for a longer-term contract aimed to integrate improved access with local urgent same-day and out-of-hour face-to-face services. The new longer-term contract will commence service delivery in October 2019.

The Commissioner wishes to use this market engagement opportunity to seek views about its strategy to commission the service. This is a process designed to help the Commissioner form a view of the best way to commission the service and is not the beginning of a Tender exercise.

It is required to be sustainable and provide value for money; based on a service model that is clinically and commercially robust; can attract and retain suitably qualified competent practitioners; and is integrated with other primary care services as appropriate. The Extended Access service will be responsive to patient needs, able and willing to respond to a challenging and changing environment, and capable of further development throughout the duration of the contract for the benefit of patients: this will include being able to respond to predicted growths in population and associated activity.

The Commissioner wishes to receive responses to the Invitation to Tender (ITT) from suitably qualified and experienced service providers with the necessary capacity and capability (or a demonstrable ability to provide the necessary capacity and capability) to provide the range of services required. 

Current services are approximately valued between £607,100 - £757,005 across the life of a five year contract. Please note that the contract is for 3 years initially, with an option to extend for a further 2 years. 

Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans are widely recognised as an efficient way of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) to predict people who are risk of fragility fractures as a result of osteoporosis or thinning bones. Identifying people who are at risk of fractures allows for appropriate interventions to be made. The scans also provide the 'Gold Standard' for diagnosing osteoporosis.

The aim is to maintain scanning rates to a level which is in line with recognised good practice for the identification and management of osteoporosis, and able to cater for future demand (e.g. ageing population).

Key objectives of the Pennine Lancashire Procurement are to:

• Provide patients with access to a DEXA scan service which serves the population of Pennine Lancashire
• Ensure patients are seen and treated in the most appropriate setting to their needs
• Deliver an integrated model of DEXA service provision for Pennine Lancashire
• Deliver affordable and value for money DEXA scan service
• Provide safe, high quality care

The needs have arisen because of disability, accident, or illness so it is vital that cases are assessed, reviewed, and managed in a timely manner. The purpose of the digitalisation of the assessment process is to improve patient and family experience by:
-	driving increased productivity; and 
-	speed in decision making.

A new digital end-to-end patient management system will provide NHS Somerset ICB with an opportunity to develop, improve, advance, and refresh the current ways of working as well as providing a new CHC model that provides optimal patient outcomes and experience through an innovative digital approach. A 'Digitalised CHC End-to-End Patient System', where information seamlessly flows between processes that will eliminate ongoing challenges with duplication and interoperability by connecting the entire CHC lifecycle into one platform. 

This system would need to support integration by the inclusion of other business functions and other patient cohorts from within NHS Somerset ICB. This includes a system that could be used by the Children's Continuing Care, Mental Health, and Safeguarding Teams in NHS Somerset; ideally, we would like a system to be optimised for their requirement.

The aim of this exercise is to understand the provider market, current and emerging practice, as well as likely level of interest in the potential procurement activity the ICB may carry out. We would appreciate an opportunity to gain insights into how your organisation could approach the delivery and implementation of an end-to-end patient management system.

Common themes that have emerged in the past year, that we want to continue supporting our staff with include, but are not limited to -
• COVID-19
• Anxiety/Stress
• Depression/Sadness
• Suicide
The requirement is for a staff support helpline, to continue to provide a psychological support offer for all NHS staff. This will aim to be a service provided for all staff during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.
The support line will offer NHS staff the opportunity to converse with trained crisis support workers, and if required, qualified clinical support where needed. The requirement will be to run a 7-day service, that can operate nationally, and is able to cater to all groups and demographics. The service will need to operate at the least, between 7:00am-11:00pm daily.

Additionally, the supplier should be able to provide anonymized and vital data, to the commissioning organisation, to provide further understanding of emerging concerns and issues related to the health and wellbeing of our workforce. Finally, the supplier should be able to provide some expertise in supporting communications and marketing, to raise awareness of the helpline.

Description of Deliverables
- Helpline accessible 7 days a week, able to be setup and delivered nationally, to all ages of NHS staff, with clinical oversight, providing immediate, anonymous and confidential support for any health and care staff member, requiring mental health or crisis support at any time
- Regular service review meetings with commissioning organisation to support delivery of the service
- Regular service data and statistics reporting, including identifying current/emerging themes on the helpline
- Regular marketing and communications support
- Agreement to work with NHS England and Improvement on any deep dive or evaluation activities relating to the helpline

Pre-market Engagement
NHS England & Improvement are currently undertaking an options appraisal and as part of this have issued a Notice to the market to gauge supplier interest and capability in relation to continuing the delivery of this service.

With the removal of this framework from 31st July 2020 and no direct replacement apprenticeship standard HEE want to ensure that the NHS can still offer a Level 2 programme to attract new talent into the NHS and also offer existing staff the opportunity to move into administration roles. HEE are therefore launching a national procurement for a NHS specific Level 2 Customer Service Practitioner apprenticeship standard and welcome bids from national and regional providers to deliver a bespoke programme that will cover the wide range of administration and patient facing roles in the NHS from 1st August 2020.

Health Education England, on behalf of NHS (and other public sector) employers nationally are looking for suitably qualified apprenticeship training organisations to adapt the Customer Service Practitioner (L2) standard to reflect the business and operational needs of health and social care, whilst fulfilling all the requirements of the Standard. This may be either national providers, or a mix of national and regional (including some NHS main providers), and could be either fully delivered by the training provider, or delivered in partnership with the employers where that capability and wish to do so exists.

HEE will be willing to work with the successful provider(s) to develop and adapt content, however the majority of that work will be expected to be carried out by the provider.

It caters for patients who without effective, safe transport could have further problems due to difficulties returning home or to a place of care. Journeys will be required both with advance notice and 'on the day'.
This can and should encompass a wide range of vehicle types and levels of care consistent with the patients' medical needs.
The overarching principle of DPTS is that patients who are eligible for transport will receive safe, timely and comfortable transport, without detriment to their medical condition.
The landscape of health care in South Yorkshire is changing and this will continue to develop with care moving away from traditional secondary care settings into more primary and community settings.  All changes will be made in consultation with the transport provider, the community and other stakeholders 
DPTS in South Yorkshire is commissioned for patients, for which the local Commissioner has responsibility, to ensure that patients are discharged from hospital in a safe and timely manner.
The DPTS provider must be ready to adapt and innovate in line with health care provision.  
Journeys from inpatient care to other inpatient care facilities such as community hospitals and hospices are considered as Inter-Site transfers.
The current guidance underpinning this service specification is that issued by the Department of Health in 2007. In the event of changes to National Policy Guidance, General Condition 13 in the NHS Standard Contract terms and conditions will apply.

The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

The purpose of undertaking the procurement was due to the Commissioner receiving notice from the previous provider of the service. A tender was published late last year to secure the delivery of these UDAs, however, no bids were received. In the interim period, the Commissioner conducted market research and testing and as a result took the decision to secure the delivery of these UDAs against a revised geographical boundary. In order to ensure accessibility to NHS Dental Services for those patients displaced by the termination, the new Service will be required to be delivered from within a 2.4km radius of the Lawrence Hill roundabout in Bristol.

The 5,000 UDAs are expected to provide dental services for approximately 2,200 patients (based on the previous provider's average of 2.3 UDAs per patient). 

The UDAs will be offered at a fixed price of £25.42 per UDA. This tariff value is based on the 2018/2019 prices with subsequent years subject to the annual DDRB uplift. 

The Commissioner will be contracting for the Services using the standard Personal Dental Services (PDS) Agreement and an appended service specification. The Agreement is offered for a 4 year period with services anticipated to commence on the 1st July 2019*.

It is expected that the successful provider will be able to immediately open their lists to all categories of patients from contract commencement and be prepared to accept the displaced patients of the NHS contract that has terminated.

The successful bidder will also be required to work closely with the NHS England Commissioning Team in order to co-ordinate and promote patient access to achieve the expected level of dental performance.

The service specification works in relation to and not instead of the NHS (General Dental Services /Personal Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005.

NHS England Midlands & East (Central Midlands) commissions a full range of NHS dental services on behalf of its population.

The NHS Five Year Forward View sets out new ways of working so that the NHS does more to prevent ill health and use its finite resources in the most effective way. It cites examples of multi-speciality working within community settings. We are using the philosophy of the Five Year Forward View to develop the Specification for community Dental Services.

NHS England Midlands & East (Central Midlands) (the Contracting Authority) is seeking to identify suitable providers of Community Dental Services (CDS) as part of its strategy for the development and delivery of special care dentistry and paediatric dentistry across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire & Milton Keynes.

Key components of the delivery model:
• Core CDS Provision - Providing quality dental care to special care and paediatric groups and selected other hard to reach groups, in both clinic and community settings
• Providing a range of public health functions for special care and paediatric groups. To limit the number of general anaesthetics carried out on children, the CDS will act as the gatekeeper for children and adults referred for treatment under general anaesthesia and sedation. Working in collaboration with Health Education England (HEE), NHSE, PHE, acute trusts and general dental practitioners to support this transition
• Provision of Dental Services for Bariatric patients who cannot otherwise access other dental services
• Urgent or emergency dental care for people who meet the criteria of this service
• Advanced services either for patients receiving comprehensive care or on referral
• Treatment under sedation including general anaesthesia
• Domiciliary Dental Services
• Oral Health Screening
• Teaching and training for dental team members
This specification may also cover: -
• Oral Health Promotion & Epidemiolgy

The lotting strategy for this procurement is yet to be determined. A needs assessment and service review is being undertaken to identify existing need and projected future health needs of the population within this particular specialised cohort.

The procurement will include a new pathway based around a single service specification with regards to paediatric referrals to eliminate pre-existing inequalities in the services.
A GA pathway redesign is being conducted as part of this procurement process.

The procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.

The purpose of undertaking the procurement is due to the Commissioner receiving notice from the previous provider of the service. In order to maintain accessibility to NHS Dental Services for those patients displaced by the termination, the new Service will be required to be delivered from within the Ashley, Easton and Lawrence Hill Dental Planning Area of Bristol.

The 5,000 UDAs are expected to provide dental services for approximately 2,200 patients (based on the previous provider's average of 2.3 UDAs per patient). 

The UDAs will be offered at a fixed price of £25.00 per UDA. This tariff value is based on the 2019/2020 prices with subsequent years subject to the annual DDRB uplift. 

The Commissioner will be contracting for the Services using the standard Personal Dental Services (PDS) Agreement and an appended service specification. The Agreement is offered for a 4 year period with services anticipated to commence on the 1st April 2019*.

It is expected that the successful provider will be able to immediately open their lists to all categories of patients from contract commencement and be prepared to accept the displaced patients of the NHS contract that has terminated.

The successful bidder will also be required to work closely with the NHS England Commissioning Team in order to co-ordinate and promote patient access to achieve the expected level of dental performance.

The NHS Five Year Forward View explains the need to redesign urgent and emergency care services in England ( the ""Review""). The Review details how these models of care can be achieved through a fundamental shift in how urgent and emergency care services are provided to all ages, improving out-of-hospital services to deliver more care closer to home and reduce hospital attendances and admissions. We need a system that is safe, sustainable and that provides quality care consistently. At present a number of products are being developed to create the conditions for new ways of working. 

The Review proposes the following key changes:
• Providing better support to self-care or care for dependents.
• Helping people who need urgent care to get the right advice in the right place, first time.
• Providing responsive, urgent physical and mental health services outside of hospital seven days a week.
• Ensuring that adults and children with more serious or life threatening emergency needs receive treatment from the right facilities, processes and expertise to maximise their chances of survival and recovery.
• Connecting all urgent and emergency care services together across thephysical and mental health and social care system.

To support this transformation, NHS England wishes to explore how improvements can be brought to clinicians who access service information at the point of care - specifically the next generation of systems that provide clinicians with access to high quality accurate information about services, their service capabilities, real time service capacity information and, connections to booking and referral systems. 

NHS England is interested in engaging with suppliers who are experts, are capable of contributing to its aims and can work in partnership with the NHS, including its partners and supply chain. NHS England would like an early and meaningful engagement with interested suppliers who will be invited to a one-day briefing to provide input into the shaping of requirements and learn about our overall ambitions and business challenges (the “Initial Briefing”). The Initial Briefing will inform industry of our plans, glean feedback and seek ideas on potential solutions. 

Interested suppliers are encouraged to register on our e-tendering portal (details below) to receive further information about the Initial Briefing and the project. During the engagement suppliers will be encouraged to use their innovation, expertise and knowledge to help NHS England to define the systems and tools that will deliver service information to clinicians, raise potential implications that might impact future service delivery models and respond to requests for an approximate magnitude costs.",,,"Any region","48982000 48985000 48986000 48600000 48482000 48984000 48983000 48800000 48783000 48461000 ",,england.ducpaccesstoserviceinformation@nhs.net,"Quarry House",,Leeds,"LS2 7UE",England,,,"Access to Service Information Additional Information.docx ","https://nhsbsa.bravosolution.co.uk ","- How to Register an Interest

The NHS Five Year Forward View explained the need to redesign urgent and emergency care services in England. Recommendations included the need to:
• Provide better support for people and their families to self-care .
• Help people who need urgent care to get the right advice.
• Provide responsive, urgent physical and mental health services outside of hospitals.
• Ensure more serious or life threatening emergency are treated in the correct facilities.
• Connecting all urgent and emergency care services 

To support these aims, NHS England wishes to explore the potential for developing a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that can be consistently used across all care settings by both clinicians and non-clinicians. Computer-based clinical decision support systems are defined as any software designed to directly aid in clinical decision making in which characteristics of individual patients are matched to a computerized knowledge  for the purpose of generating patient-specific assessments.

Specifically NHS England's aim to through the CDSS:
• Be able to personalise clinical assessment depending on the patient and their historical and current data.
• Use technology and multi-channel approaches to be able to fast track patients to the care they need.
• Be able to learn, improve, and develop based on outcomes data.

At this time, NHS England believes that the CDSS may need to comprise the following elements:
• Patient Management System.
• Decision Support Software. 
• Prioritisation and Streaming software.
• Access to Services Directory.
• Interoperability: the ability to interact with a number of existing systems. 
• Reporting functionality: the ability for national, local and individual user level access to management information.
• Assessment of the impact on service design and the workforce.
• Digital self-service by users.
• Telephone assessment and triage of patients by call centre agents.
• Prioritisation and direction by non-clinical staff.
• Supporting assessment of patients in a clinical environment.
• A single point of syndromic monitoring, and alerting to public health
emergencies.

NHS England is committed to having early and meaningful engagement with suppliers, research institutions and clinicians, who can demonstrate innovation and ideas that will contribute to its aims for the development of CDSS.  To achieve this NHS England will hold a briefing day on the 30th November 2015 in London, and it is anticipated this will be followed by a series of market engagement activities. The briefing event will provide information about our overall vision and business challenges.

The NDPP aims to deliver, at a large scale, services which identify people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia who are at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and offer them a behavioural intervention to reduce their weight and increase physical activity. The NDPP has three distinct phases which have been designed to develop the evidence in a staged way and to enable checks and balances to be built into the NDPP as it is implemented:

•             Pre-procurement phase: work with seven demonstrator sites to test implementation of the NDPP. This phase is already underway and will be completed in 2015/16;  
•             Phase 1 Procurement 2015/16 to go live 2016/17: between 10,000 and 30,000 behavioural interventions across England are identified; and 
•             Phase 2 Procurement in 2016 to go live 2017/18: will aim to deliver long-term contracts providing for incremental scaling up of services with a view to full coverage across England by 2019/20 (subject to final decisions about the pace of implementation).

A rapid review of referral processes, systems and forms across Kent, Medway, Surrey and Sussex has identified that a variety of processes exist in each area with varying degrees of clinical triage depending on the type of service. Some of those legacy administrative services are soon due to cease, such as the Oral Surgery Primary Care Booking Service and the Endodontic Referral Administration Service in Kent.

At present we know that waiting times vary across specialised services ; that the quality of referrals are variable resulting in inconsistent acceptance of cases and therefore difference in access to services. Waiting times for treatment between secondary care and community based services differ potentially resulting in inefficiency and inequality.

The current system poses operational commissioning challenges making it difficult to assess service need and define future commissioning intentions; it is also challenging to monitor the quality of services. With the development of the Dental Assurance Framework there is a greater need to improve the quality of reporting information. The NHS is challenged to deliver high quality care for all. A more reliable and efficient referral system it needed to support local practitioners.

Therefore NHS England has commissioned a Dental Electronic Referral Service that can manage all dental referrals for NHS dental services within Kent, Medway, Surrey and Sussex.
The overall aims of the service are to:
•	Provide clinicians with a single mechanism to refer patients that require specialist and specialised NHS dental services;
•	Improve the quality of referrals in order to support effective triage;
•	Enable patients to access care that is most suited to their needs;
•	Improve the efficiency of the referral process;
•	Provide accurate referral information to support clinical service evaluation and development; and
•	Achieve value for money.",,,"South East","85130000 48600000 ","Samit Shah",samit.shah@nhs.net,"NHS England – South (South East)","Wharf House, Medway Wharf Road",Tonbridge,"TN9 1RE",England,,,,,,03/08/2015,31/07/2020,18/05/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1000000,1375000,20/07/2015,1375000,"[Vantage Diagnostics|Barkat House, 116-118 Finchley Road, London NW3 5HT|||No|No]",,03/08/2015,31/07/2020,"Open ",

The approach is called ‘value based commissioning (VBC)’. As part of the process, the CCGs now wish to assess whether there are providers who would have the willingness, capability and capacity to be able to successfully lead delivery of VBC for patients within North Central London across specific projects. 

Value Based Commissioning is seen as a key strategic initiative within the Five Year Strategic Plan for the CCGs. Value based commissioning is about working collaboratively with our providers to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients for every pound spent.  Developing a shared common goal unites the interests of all - patients, commissioners and providers - in support of a sustainable and high quality health care system.  In addition, this approach drives different providers to work together to better co-ordinate care for patients, improving patient experience and outcomes.  Where such an approach has been implemented, as in stroke care across London, measurable improvements in outcomes have been achieved. 

The aim of the CCGs’ value based commissioning programme is to promote a greater focus on measuring and achieving the outcomes that matter to patients. The CCGs are focusing first on older people living with frailty across Haringey and people with diabetes across Islington and Haringey.  The CCGs are aiming to embed this approach within 2015/16 and therefore interested in hearing the views of providers and other stakeholders to ensure the proposed approach achieves the best outcomes for service users.

The Memorandum of Information that accompanies this Contract Notice provides further detail on the project scope, the outcomes measured and the service design attributes. The scope of the service is currently being developed and such that the financial envelope remains an estimate (between £25 - £35 million per annum) and could increase or decrease accordingly. The contract is expected to be for the duration of three to five years (providing the outcomes within the contract are delivered) with an option to extend it for a further two years. 

Registration is through the Pro-Contract e-tendering portal which can be accessed at www.supplying2nhs.com.

Aims and objectives of service

The Norfolk & Waveney CCGs (NHS North Norfolk CCG, NHS South Norfolk CCG, NHS Norwich CCG, NHS West Norfolk CCG and NHS Great Yarmouth & Waveney CCG) are undertaking a piece of work to identify the appropriate commissioning strategy and delivery vehicle for their Locally Commissioned Services and potentially other services going forward. This work is aligned to the Norfolk & Waveney CCGs' STP plan and is set against a backdrop of the NHS Five Year Forward View, the development of new models of care and the local challenges facing the CCGs and general practice. 

The geographic scope of the contract will be aligned to the Norfolk & Waveney CCGs' localities and will cover 108 general practice populations, which is equivalent to a combined list size of approximately 1 million. The contract will, however, be structured to allow for growth in the number of patients.

It is the CCGs' intention to let 5 contracts, one at each CCG level, to deliver a range of locally commissioned services. It is also the intention of the CCGs to structure the contract to allow for additional services to be included in the scope of the contract during the period of the contract.",,,"East of England","85000000 ","Camilla Ball",agcsu.southprocurement@nhs.net,"St John's House,30 East Street",,LEICESTER,LE16NB,England,01216110105,https://ardengemcsu.bravosolution.co.uk/,"READ ME - INSTRUCTIONS TO REGISTER FOR EVENT AND GIVE FEEDBACK Contracts Finder FINAL V1 01.11.18.pdf ","https://ardengemcsu.bravosolution.co.uk/ ","Services in scope

The CCGs wish to engage with the market and stakeholders regarding appropriate in-scope services, however to enable interested parties to understand the types of services that may be included, a list of services being considered is included below, however this is subject to change to remove services and also add services to this list:

General ECG & 24 hour Ambulatory ECG Monitoring
•	24hr ECG

•	Anti-Coagulation
•	Phlebotomy
Treatment Room
•	Nursing and Diagnostics Service
•	Regular Medication Injections including B12 & Sustanon

DVT
•	DVT
Eating Disorders and Weight Management
•	Community Eating Disorders
•	Eating Disorders
Minor Injury
•	Minor Injury
•	Post-Operative Care
•	Simple Dressings and Wound Care.

Integration, Innovation and Transformation 

The CCGs' shared strategy is to design a delivery model that is both innovative and transformational. The CCGs' vision is to deliver relevant services in a fully integrated and patient centric manner across the whole of the health and social care spectrum. They will therefore need to ensure that the locally commissioned services can be delivered in a way which supports progress towards integration of services.

The objective of this work is to ensure that the portfolio of local services commissioned by the CCGs is appropriately aligned with their strategic vision, as well as best quality of outcomes for patients. 

Interim Service Provision

The CCGs believe that for the above strategy to be fully delivered they should undertake a 2-year Interim Service Provision of at-scale working through GP federations, the ""Review Period"". This will commence on 1st October 2019. The key outputs will be to test and refine service pathways, contract mechanisms and outcome metrics before committing to a longer-term contract ensuring that the service is ready to enable the vision described above to be delivered. This sets a clear deadline for a full open procurement process, which would / should commence in October 2020 for service commencement in October 2021.

Working with colleagues at 12 NHS organisations from around the country, NHS England has established a programme to: 

•	improve the health and wellbeing of our staff; 
•	reduce sickness absence and the associated costs; and
•	demonstrate that the NHS is ‘getting our own house in order’ as we make a case for the role of work in supporting health and wellbeing.

NHS England is providing a range of support to a group of 12 NHS organisations as they extend the health and wellbeing offer to their staff. This includes funding new or enhanced health and wellbeing services, encouraging a culture change in leadership, and training managers. These are: 

•	NHS Health Checks: lifestyle checks for staff aged 40-74 
•	Services to prevent and treat muscular-skeletal problems;
•	Services to prevent and treat mental ill-health; 
•	A culture of strong leadership and management of staff health; 
•	A range of healthy lifestyle support services

These 12 NHS organisations will have a significantly more extensive health and wellbeing offer for their staff than is common across the NHS. 

The intention is to roll this programme out nationally but before this is done; NHS England wishes to carry out an impact and process evaluation to establish the efficacy of the current roll out.

The current level of activity is circa 550 patients and the current budget is circa £108K per annum. The initial contract would be for a period of 3 years.

The Anticoagulation Warfarin Monitoring and Management Service in the NHS Vale of York CCG area was, in the main, historically provided by York Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust through a traditional phlebotomy-based service. The CCG is now transferring this service from secondary care into the community, using a near patient testing model.

The new service will be predominantly provided in primary care. However, the CCG is looking for a single/lead provider to ensure service provision for patients from all of the following practices:

For 2017/18, £40m will be used to fund a range of workforce developments for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working in a range of settings to better integrate pharmacy into NHS primary care services. 
HEE is working in partnership with NHS England to drive forward the workforce elements of the Pharmacy Integration Fund. This work is part of a broader HEE agenda to drive workforce transformation across the NHS to support locally delivered integrated care models.
One of these elements is the development and delivery of a workforce development programme for pharmacists who will be working in NHS 111  or similar Integrated Urgent Care (IUC) settings.
From 2017/18, an NHS England national programme will recruit pharmacists to work in NHS 111/IUC to clinically assess and treat patients using their expert knowledge of medicines.  They will be prescribers (or training to become one) and will work with/alongside colleagues of other disciplines in a multi-disciplinary team. They will provide leadership on person-centred medicines optimisation and quality improvement, with the role having the potential to significantly improve patient safety and the quality of care. HEE anticipates that the workforce development programme will support pharmacists (and in turn their employers) to realise these goals.
There are specific areas of knowledge, or specific competencies, required more frequently from pharmacists working in this setting. But while it is important for the pharmacist be competent in key responsibilities and activities, HEE recognises that a pharmacist's confidence, preparedness and adaptability for this setting are also key to achieving the desired outcomes.
HEE expects that this workforce programme will lead to the development of a highly-skilled pharmacist, confident to operate remotely from patients and from colleagues, and able to offer expert medicines advice and patient care through NHS 111/IUC.

The Authorities are inviting tenders for the provision of NHS Health Checks.  Leicestershire County Council will be the lead Authority to procure NHS Health Checks.  The Authority is conducting this procurement under the Light Touch Regime for Social and Other Specific Services, as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/102) (as amended) (""The 2015 Regulations"").

The Leicestershire and Rutland NHS Health Check programme should be delivered in accordance with the contractual and statutory requirements of the GMS/PMS/APMS contracts/agreements.

Contracted suppliers must comply with all applicable statutory and other legal requirements and regulations, all relevant voluntary and compulsory codes of conduct, all relevant professional standards and all applicable National Health Service and County Council directives, guidelines and codes, as stipulated in the service specification.

The NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England aged 40 to 74. It's designed to spot early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia. As we get older, we have a higher risk of developing one of these conditions. An NHS Health Check helps find ways to lower this risk

The NHS Health Check programme aims to improve the health and wellbeing of adults aged 40-74 years through the promotion of early awareness, assessment, and management of the major risk factors for CVD - risk factors that are associated with premature death, disability and health inequalities. This will in turn reduce levels of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and associated premature mortality in Leicestershire County and Rutland County through primary care; ensuring systematic and proactive identification and management of patients with greater than or equal to 10% or greater risk of CVD event in next 10 years (based on a 10-year risk equation).

This contract is similar to a Framework Agreement but under the Light Touch Regime, which will commence on 01 April 2023.  This will be in place for an initial period of 1 year, with an option to extend for a further period or periods up to a total of 36 months in twelve monthly increments, taking the contract term to a maximum of 4 years.

It has a collective responsibility to act, with all 1.3 million staff having a role to play.

Ambulance Trusts utilise one of two approved triage tools to support non-clinical call handlers in the assessment, categorisation and provision of advice in relation to 999 calls.  These are known as Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) and NHS Pathways. EEAST utilises MPDS which then requires a separate clinical module and interface to provide the clinical ""hear and treat"" function. Alongside some Ambulance Trusts for their 999 triage system, NHS 111 Providers also all utilise NHS Pathways. Some Ambulance Trusts provide the NHS 111 function directly in an integrated way with their 999 service (using Pathways for both services). In doing this other ambulance services have taken on a crucial coordination and gatekeeping role by providing coordinated delivery of 111, clinical assessment services and 999 from the point of the call. EEAST has a long-term aspiration to progress towards a similar model in the future.

The Trust is therefore seeking to carry out a review of its triage system (MPDS) against the alternative (NHS Pathways) to inform future strategic decision making.

The Apprenticeship Benefits Realisation Strategy includes objectives to: 
•	meet the skills needs of employers; 
•	create progression for apprentices; 
•	widen participation and social mobility; and 
•	create more quality apprenticeships. 
To deliver these benefits within the NHS, Trusts and Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) need support to become informed apprenticeship customers and to develop apprenticeship strategies that meet the needs of their workforce strategies. 
If the NHS were treated as a single employer, it would be the biggest employer in England. It is a major contributor to both the apprenticeship levy and public sector apprenticeship target. It is expected to deliver over a third of all public sector apprenticeships.  The NHS has an estimated annual public sector target of around 28,000 new apprentice starts. 
The ESFA is looking to award a grant to a delivery organisation who will engage with senior leaders within NHS Trusts and STP's.
In particular we are looking for the following outcomes to be achieved:
•	Engage senior leaders within NHS Trusts, e.g. Finance Directors, HR Directors and Chief Executives
•	Secure their active support as apprenticeship champions within their organisations, ensuring operational staff have the necessary leadership and resources.
•	'Open doors' for our account managers to reach decision-makers.

It is joint led by NHS Digital, Health Education England and NHS England and has an end of March 2021.

The FYFV made a commitment that, by 2020, there would be ""fully interoperable electronic health records so that patients' records are paperless"". This was supported by a Government commitment in PHC2020 that ""all patient and care records will be digital, interoperable and real-time by 2020"". all this requires information to flow more effectively across health and care to support the delivery of direct patient care and it requires a workforce who are equipped with the skills, knowledge, values and behaviours to lead and undertake this change and work within this environment. The BDRW programme delivers upon the workforce elements of PHC2020 and its scope is across the entirety of health and care (1.6 million social care staff, 1.4 million NHS staff in England).

Subsequently, the Martha Lane Fox Review for NIB in 2016 pointed to the need to develop the basic digital skills of the NHS workforce to ensure that everyone has the digital skills needed to support people's health needs. Additionally, the Wachter Review for the Secretary of State (SoS) in 2016 recognised a lack of clinical and non-clinical informatics professionals (notably CIO, CCIO level) to deliver change, and led to the SoS making a commitment to establish a NHS Digital Academy, one of the key deliverables of the BDRW programme.

In summary, the outcomes we are aiming towards:
•	Improved change/transformation programmes e.g. due to:
-	More effective leadership decision making resulting from leadership campaigns for NHS Trust and care boards, based on an understanding of digital issues that include data security.
-	CIOs/CCIOs being equipped with the skills and knowledge to perform their roles effectively, including those relating to health information systems & technologies; user-centred design & citizen-driven informatics; leadership & transformational change; and decision-support, knowledge management & data analytics.
•	Improved quality of services; e.g., due to digital literacy skills as an enabler for better quality care resulting from increased capability and competence, better understanding of data, information, knowledge and technology, better decision making; and a more flexible workforce.
•	An environment where the 'informatics contribution' outside day-to-day clinical work plays a part in supporting the revalidation process. 
•	Improved staff satisfaction, recruitment & retention; e.g., due to opportunities for individuals to advance their careers with clear opportunities and career paths, and recognition of thei",,,"Any region","73000000 85300000 80561000 ","Anthony Oba",anthony.oba@hee.nhs.uk,"1st Floor, Blenheim House","Duncombe Street",Leeds,"LS1 4PL",England,"+44 7500100580",https://hee.nhs.uk/,,,,18/11/2018,31/03/2020,03/10/2018,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,100000,100000,,,,,,,"NotApplicable ",

It is a risk assessment and management programme that aims to prevent or delay the onset of major non-communicable disease including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and kidney disease through earlier awareness, assessment, and management of risk factors and conditions.  These assessments are targeted at those aged 40 to 74 years with no diagnosed long term conditions. This service will deliver NHS Health Checks in the community alongside those delivered in General Practice. 
In Camden and Islington we recognise that the burden of ill health is such that our populations would benefit from lifestyle interventions that stretch beyond the national eligibility criteria and remit of the NHS Health Checks. 
The immediate aim of both NHS Health Checks and Lifestyle Checks is to identify risk factors; deliver healthy living messages; and motivate behaviour change through relevant behaviour change techniques and onward referral to GPs and the Lifestyle Hub. The approach to Lifestyle Checks has been determined locally but is based on the best practice of the lifestyle elements of the NHS Health Check.

Lot 2: Medical Consumables - Rehabilitation and Community
Lot 3: Non-Medical - Food; and
Lot 4: Non: Medical - Facilities (including Office Solutions)

During the procurement, Lots 1 and 2 were abandoned, and Lots 3 and 4 continued through to award of contract.

In accordance with Regulation 55(1)(b) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Authority advises that it did not conclude the procurement procedure for Lots 1 and 2. The procurement commenced on 11/04/2022 under Contract Notice reference 2022/S 000-009671, the decision in respect of Lot 1 and 2 was based on value for money and organisational strategy considerations. The Authority determined that it will transition the services covered by Lots 1 and 2 of the Procurement to an internal delivery model. The Authority considered that insourcing these services will better achieve the objectives of the target operating model.

The Authority will therefore not be awarding any contract for Lot 1 or Lot 2 pursuant to this procurement.

As outlined above, the procurement in respect of Lots 3 and 4 continued, and the Authority has awarded contracts for Lots 3 and 4 as outlined within this award notice.

Each contract will be for an initial period of forty-five months (excluding the anticipated three month implementation period) and may be extended for up to an additional twenty-four months subject to achieving the relevant criteria set out in the contract.

NHSE/I South West Region is seeking to award a contract for an organisation to deliver an Oral Health Needs Assessment (OHNA) for the South West of England by 30th September 2020 at the latest.

Dental commissioning is a key priority area for NHSE/I's direct commissioning function, and the intention is to commission an OHNA to commence as soon as possible and for completion within six months of commencement. The OHNA is key in terms of informing commissioning strategy and transformation for dental services in the South West.

The OHNA will provide a review of oral health needs and dental services.  It is intended that the results of the OHNA will inform the planning and implementation of appropriate services, and oral health improvement strategies targeted at those at specific risk, or in underserved population subgroups.

The OHNA will cover Devon; Cornwall; Somerset; Dorset; Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire; Gloucestershire; Swindon, Wiltshire, Bath and North East Somerset. It will also include specifically the oral health needs of the prison population in the South West.

Through identifying and gathering sources of existing and relevant data and information which support the needs assessment process, the OHNA will:

• Research and describe the oral health characteristics of the population and identify their needs including for populations at risk of poor oral health
• Measure the capacity of existing service provision to meet need, and identify any areas where additional capacity or provision is required in terms of supporting the oral health needs of the population
• Identify aspects of service provision where further investigation/analysis may be needed

The output from the OHNA would be a reference document reporting on the objectives above. It is expected that such an Oral Needs Assessment will take a maximum of six months to complete on the basis of approximately 2 -3 days per week working, however ideally would be undertaken on the basis of 5 days per week for earlier completion

NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) are working on behalf of Southport & Formby CCG and South Sefton CCG who wish to procure an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service for patients living in the CCG areas.  

Reaching Crossens in the north to Bootle in the south, Sefton is surrounded by Lancashire to the north and east, Liverpool to the south and the Irish sea to the west. Sefton as a whole has a population in the region of 280,000. There are pockets of both severe deprivation and extreme wealth and earnings are 14% below the weekly national average.  52% of the population are female and 1 in 5 of the total population is 65 and over. 3 in every 100 residents are from a BME background and it is estimated that the total population will increase by 2.2% by 2037. 1 in 4 Sefton residents have their day to day activities limited by having a long-term condition.  

 Sefton's health care is commissioned by Southport and Formby CCG and South Sefton CCG with a Sefton MBC providing social care for the whole area.

The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies has been running successfully in Southport & Formby CCG and South Sefton CCG since April 2015.

The CCGs are looking for Expressions of Interest (EoIs) who are able to provide steps 2 and 3 of a stepped care model as defined in the IAPT Manual which will be delivered by a multi-disciplinary team which will be delivered within the following nationally defined modes of delivery:

1.	Core IAPT
2.	IAPT-Long Term Conditions (LTC)

The contract value is approximately £2,760,000 per annum which equates to £13.8million over the proposed 5-year contract (a 3-year contract with the option to extend for a further 2-year period).

The CCGs are looking to gain Expressions of Interest (EoIs) from providers who could be interested in delivering IAPT services to patients in the 2 CCG areas.  Any interested organisation needs to visit https://mlcsu.bravosolution.co.uk/ to complete a short questionnaire regarding delivery of the IAPT service in the CCG areas.  This information will inform and assist the CCGs in forming their Commissioning Intentions for IAPT services.

The CCGs are only seeking expressions of interest from Providers who are genuinely capable and attracted to this potential opportunity. Please only express an interest if you have the relevant authority to do so on behalf of your Provider.

Locally, there is a strong opportunity to innovate and develop different approaches, changing the way mental health care is delivered. The CCGs along with partner organisations want to offer improved support to people who find themselves in a mental health crisis in community settings, and offer constructive/effective alternatives to presenting at the Emergency Department or admission to hospital.    

The aims of the service are;              
•	To provide a safe, welcoming and comfortable place for people in crisis, and those seeking to prevent the onset of a crisis.  The opening hours would reflect the needs for   providing this service in the late evenings. 
•	To meet the needs of individuals experiencing acute emotional distress associated with a mental health problem (which may or may not have been given a formal diagnosis) with the aim of drawing on strengths, resilience and coping mechanisms to reduce the need to use crisis services in the future.
•	To support an individual to reduce their immediate crisis and anxiety, and to formulate a safety plan, drawing on strengths, resilience and coping mechanisms to reduce the need to use crisis services in the future.
•	To offer a multi-agency team  (MDT) approach to individual need, to ensure needs are responded to by appropriate services to further help the individual to build resilience. It is expected that there will be a full range of services provided at The Haven by a full range of organisations.    

The CCGs are seeking to identify suitably experienced providers who would be interested in the opportunity to manage The Haven. Plans are underway for the CCGs to secure a suitable property in the Preston area to deliver this service from.  If these plans are achieved the CCGs will be seeking a suitable provider to operate the service from those premises. However the CCGs also need to consider alternative options and may proceed with a procurement whereby providers are asked to bid to deliver the service and source the property.  Therefore at this stage as part of this EOI the CCGs are also requesting information from providers in relation to potential access to other suitable properties.  

The CCGs are anticipating having a budget of approx. £350,000 per year to deliver this service. This does not cover any costs associated with the property and is to deliver the service only. The budget for property costs is approx. £50,000 per year (rent and maintenance costs).

The CCGs are likely to consider a Contract duration of 3 years with the option to extend for 2 years.

The GP at Hand service is an innovative approach to offering digital-first primary care, currently based within a Hammersmith and Fulham (H&F) GP practice, but offering care to patients across London (and ultimately across England).

GP at Hand is the name of a GMS contract-holding general practice providing Primary Medical Services under the GMS Regulations 2015 in North West London, previously known as Dr Jeffries and Partners.  They are now offering an innovative, 'digital-first' model of primary care, primarily through use of a mobile app and video consultations provided by their subcontractor, Babylon Health.

The app enables patients to access GP services 24/7, at short notice, via a virtual appointment using video conferencing and voice calls on a smartphone.  Patients can also access symptom-checker services (driven by Babylon's Artificial Intelligence tool) and health monitoring software.  If patients need a face-to-face appointment they can access in-person services in one of GP at Hand's six London-based sites.  All patients accessing the service de-register from their previous NHS practice, and register with GP at Hand.  

The service takes advantage of the National GP Choice policy to allow patients from across London to register with the service, with plans to expand the service nationwide.  There are some limitations put on registrations from people with more complex care needs, who might need greater continuity of care, and more face-to-face support - with NHS England's clinical review recommending that those individuals seek advice before registering.

The Academy aims to share learning of evidence-based models of health and social care, supporting implementation across the capital and sharing the latest research.

The NHS London Violence Reduction Programme is pleased to announce our plans to launch a Violence Reduction Academy.
 
The purpose of London Violence Reduction Programme is to lead the way in shaping how the NHS can support violence reduction and improve wellbeing in our communities at a population and individual level. The programme achieves this by:
•	Developing a shared understanding of violence reduction;
•	Building a movement within health and care that listens to young people; co-creating approaches that improve wellbeing and reduces health inequalities;
•	Developing an evidence base that demonstrates the impact of violence reduction programmes for young people, their families and the communities they live in;
•	Working in partnership across systems to develop and implement preventative approaches to reducing violence.
 
The programme comprises of a number of London-wide projects designed to deliver change, and are well placed to bring young people, their families, NHS, local authorities and other key stakeholders together to implement violence reduction models across London.
 
The Violence Reduction Academy will be a key delivery vehicle of the NHS London Violence Reduction programme. The Academy aims to gather learning of evidence-based models of health and social care, supporting implementation across the capital and sharing the best education and research. A key enabler to the success of the Academy is recognising existing areas of good practice and encouraging collaboration across system partners.
 
To support us with evidence building and information gathering, we intend to fund an academic partner to undertake a wide-ranging review of current services and interventions and to provide evidence of best practice (and challenges) in clear and easily accessible formats for health and care professionals. We will be asking the partner to recruit and host Research Fellows (x2 0.5 WTE) and an Academic Supervisor (0.1 WTE) to deliver this work.
 
We would like to extend an invitation for you and interested partners to join us at the VR Academy's Market Engagement Event taking place on 12 December from 11am - 12:30pm. The aim of the event is to provide further information on our ambitions,  generate interest in the project and answer queries from interested organisations.

The NHS staff helpline was also a key recommendation of the NHS Staff and Learners' Mental Wellbeing Commission report in 2019:

Evaluation findings on the helpline have indicated that staff continue to contact the helpline with concerns, and that there is a need for psychological support independent of the NHS.

The 18F-DOPA PET-CT scan is used to identify patients who have the focal (rather than diffuse) form of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), who would benefit from surgery and the precise location of the focal lesions so that they can be removed.   

18F-DOPA PET-CT scans are only performed at Institute of Nuclear medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. At present, about ten 18F-DOPA PET-CT scans are performed annually.

The supplier will be required to manufacture, quality assure and control and deliver 18F-DOPA as required (circa ten doses per year). The supplier will need to be flexible in its scheduling of the production of 18F-DOPA to meet the service needs of the scan providers at University College London Hospital and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. The tracer will need to be manufactured and transported to the scan provider in a quantity that ensures that there is sufficient activity in the product to carry out an effective scan.

The purpose of undertaking the procurement was due to the Commissioner receiving notice from the previous provider of the service. The service was previously provided from BA11 2HA, and the new service will be required to be delivered from within a 2 mile radius of BA11 2HA. 

The 8,000 UDAs are expected to provide dental services for approximately 3000 patients (based on the 2016/17 Frome average of 2.7 UDAs per patient). 

The UDAs will be offered at a fixed price of £25.00 per UDA, which is non-negotiable. 

The Commissioner will be contracting for the Services using the standard Personal Dental Services (PDS) Agreement and an appended service specification. The Agreement is offered for a 5 year period with service commencement on the 1st November 2018.

It is expected that the successful provider will be able to immediately accept new patients from contract commencement, and provide continuity of NHS dental care for those patients that have been displaced following the termination of the current service. 

The successful bidder will also be required to work closely with the NHS England Commissioning Team in order to co-ordinate and promote patient access to achieve the expected level of dental performance.

The service specification works in relation to and not instead of the NHS (General Dental Services /Personal Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005.",,,"South West","85000000 ","Hannah Morley",scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,"South Plaza","Marlborough Street",BRISTOL,BS13NX,England,,https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home,,,"The services are healthcare services falling within Schedule 3 to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (""the Regulations"")  which are not subject to the full regime of the Regulations, but is instead governed by the ""Light Touch Regime"" contained within Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Regulations (Regulations 74 to 77).",01/11/2018,31/10/2023,26/04/2018,YES,PR002588,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1000000,,03/07/2018,1000000,"[Integrated Dental Holdings|Europa House

NHS England are currently baselining the existing system, gathering requirements for the new service and developing a full business case for procurement of such.
The CWT system allows the collection of data from all trusts diagnosing or treating cancer patients across the English NHS, and the reporting of those data against the national cancer waiting times standards. In addition to this current functionality, the new system requires additional features. For example, it will need to be able to accommodate the new 28 day referral to diagnosis standard, including not just the additional data items, but the ability to collect data from potentially many additional sources, and the ability to track patients effectively across multiple organisations. Interoperability is crucial – the system will need to be compatible with multiple other systems, flexible enough to accommodate future changes, and easily linked to additional datasets to enable further insight.
We are keen to run an open discussion workshop with potential suppliers to share our initial thoughts, conduct an open Question and Answer session and gather feedback in writing after the event on
— the viability of the approach;
— alternative approaches that could be considered;
— realistic timescales to deliver;

Any values and timescales stated within this PIN notice are for guideline purposes only and should not be taken as a guarantee.

NHS Aylesbury Vale Clinical Commissioning Group (“CCG”) wishes to commission a Thames Valley enhanced 111 service model.

NHS 111 is a free-to-call 111 telephone number available 24 hours each day, 365 days a year, offering a personalised priority contact service that responds to individual healthcare needs when:

1.	It is not a life-threatening situation;
2.	The patient's registered General Practitioner is not an option;
3.	The caller feels they cannot wait (and may be unsure of what service they require);
4.	The caller requires health information or reassurance about what to do next.

NHS 111 forms an important part of the vision for locally integrated urgent and emergency care services. It delivers a vital service in helping members of the public with urgent care needs to gain access to the right advice in the right place, first time.
The service will be staffed by trained advisors, supported by clinicians, using a specified clinical triage tool alongside local Directory of Services to assess caller needs and determine the most appropriate course of action, which may include dispatching an ambulance, providing clinical advice or information, providing reassurance, or referring the caller to an alternative service.

At a minimum, the service provider would be expected to demonstrate a capability to deliver the National Core Specification for NHS 111 produced by the UK Department of Health, NHS 111 Commissioning Standards published by NHS England (June 2014) and the Out of Hours National Quality Requirements (“NQRs”) where this is applied for.

The service provider will need to evidence that all staff responding to callers are capable of carrying out their duties competently and to a standard that meets the requirements of the Contract Specification.

The 10 CCGs covered by this procurement exercise are:
Aylesbury Vale CCG
Bracknell & Ascot CCG
