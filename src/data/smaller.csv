Norfolk County Council, like many other local authorities, has a holding list of referrals for people waiting an intervention including a Care Act assessment or reassessment, including supporting our focused post discharge assessment work. Undertaking Care Act assessments and reassessments is a statutory requirement where a person appears to the local authority to be in need of a community care service. The assessment of need, including a determination of eligibility under the Act, will include a strength's-based discussion between the person referred, their representatives and the assessor, where they will discuss care and support needs, and the goals the person wishes to achieve. This will include identifying the person's strengths, capacity within the person's social networks and local community to help and how the local authority will support the person to promote their independence to prevent, reduce and delay the need for formal care services. Where formal care services are required, the assessor will complete a Care & Support Plan with the person and help broker the services required either from community assets or commissioned services. Where safeguarding concerns, harm or other risks are identified, the assessor will ensure an appropriate response is arranged, usually supported or led by the local authority. The completion of the Care Act assessment or reassessment and Care & Support Plan for individuals who are on the Holding list will therefore be of benefit to the individuals and those supporting them, as well as supporting Norfolk County Council to meet its statutory duties and prepare for transformation of its ways of working.

tender_313109/1098584,Contract,Defra Network eTendering Portal,Closed,2022-08-17T10:47:13+01:00,High Pressure Washing for Radiological Decontamination of Concrete Surfaces,"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is commissioning small-scale research to investigate the viability of high-pressure washing for decontaminating UK concrete building materials following a major radiation incident. Defra is the designated Lead Government Department in England for coordinating the recovery from Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) incidents in England. To that end, Defra facilitates UK access to decontamination capabilities for buildings, environment, and infrastructure following a CBRN incident. When not recovering from a CBRN event, Defra develops recovery policy and operational capability by working closely with cross government colleagues, academia, and industry.
The aim of this project is to test the suitability of high-pressure washing procedures to decontaminate UK concrete surfaces contaminated with 85Sr, 137Cs, and 152Eu. This project consists of 2 stages. 
The objectives of stage 1 of this project are:
-	Source suitable concrete samples from the UK built environment and then contaminate with 85Sr, 137Cs, and 152Eu under laboratory conditions (Objective 1).

-	Measure radionuclide depth profiles after aging the contaminated samples for a maximum of 2 months. This aging period is considered representative of decontamination operations after a significant radiation incident (Objective 2).

The objectives of stage 2 of this project are:

-	Determine the effect of three different water pressures (between 2,000 and 7,000 psi) on the radionuclide removal rates from contaminated concrete samples (Objective 3).

-	Examine the potential for high pressure washing to induce aesthetic and/or physical damage to the decontaminated materials by visual inspection and appropriate microscopy technique(s) (Objective 4).
It is important to note that the duration of stage 1 of the project is 5.5 months. A 6-month extension to the project is available for stage 2, subject to satisfactory completion of stage 1. It is acceptable for Tenderers to submit a tender for stage 1 of the project only.",,,London,73000000,Defra,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,17 Nobel House,,London,SW1P 3JR,England,0,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk,ITT 10590 High Pressure Washing for Radiological Decontamination of Concrete Surfaces_FINAL.pdf ,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ,,10/10/2022,31/03/2023,23/09/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,0.0,,,,,,,,OpenNonOJEU ,,12:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"High Pressure Washing for Radiological Decontamination of Concrete Surfaces The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is commissioning small-scale research to investigate the viability of high-pressure washing for decontaminating UK concrete building materials following a major radiation incident.

To achieve this, the project will review existing evidence, prioritisation criteria and methodologies to identify any gaps to enable the prioritisation of sites requiring the most urgent action.

Raytheon UK is planning to issue a full two-stage Tender by 1st June 2023 and intends to hold two Bidder Briefing Events on 16th May 2023 and 17th May 2023 - which will be held online via Microsoft Teams. The first session will be an open event to provide Bidders with an introduction and overview of the procurement and the second session is for one-to-one sessions with potential Bidders. Any relevant information shared within one-to-one sessions will be anonymised and shared with other Bidders to ensure a fair and transparent process.

Interested parties are requested to express their interest by no later than 5pm, Friday 5th May 2023 to participate in the briefing sessions by emailing: molly.coburn@raytheon.co.uk.

Summary of Services:

The SCT is a high-fidelity simulated training environment used to provide ship control Individual and Team Training. It allows for multiple trainees to be trained simultaneously across different onboard duties. Trainees will interact with and manipulate multiple engineering solutions represented on a fully dynamic representation and high-fidelity simulated training environment that mirrors the Ship Control positions in the vessel's main command and control room. The full motion high-fidelity simulated training environment will incorporate a 6 degrees of freedom platform. 

Raytheon is undertaking this PIN in order to seek the views and opinions of those capable organisations that may be interested in helping to deliver this solution.

Participation in this PIN exercise is not a mandatory requirement for participating in any potential future procurement(s); however, responses received will assist to inform Raytheon UK as to the level of interest from the market and will be used to evidence a decision as to whether or not to undertake a competitive procurement.

Brief Description of Requirement
Innovate UK is the UK's national innovation agency. We support business-led innovation in all sectors, technologies and UK regions. We will help the UK achieve a net zero carbon economy in 2050 and better protect the environment. We aim to help the UK become a global leader in transitioning to a net zero economy by building a coherent, supportive environment enabling people and businesses to innovate. 
 
We face a time limited challenge to achieve net zero by 2050 and recognise the opportunity for businesses to grow to significantly impact this and offer global solutions. Innovative scalable net zero businesses and solutions are needed to reach our net zero targets, however there is a market failure that will prevent many of them from reaching maturity. 
 
Innovate UK wants to convene, create dialogue and action by bringing together the net zero innovation and sector specific investment and procurement communities to accelerate adoption at scale and sector investment.  We want to deliver a programme of events and activities that;
-	provide opportunities for net zero businesses to engage relevant investors
-	give investors insight on market opportunities in the net zero sector
-	unlock barriers for net zero businesses to grow and scale, and
-	enhance the net zero innovation ecosystem. 
 
We are seeking an external partner to design, develop and deliver this 2 Â½ year programme in partnership with Innovate UK, Innovate UK KTN and Innovate UK EDGE. This programme should be delivered with the ambition to grow to be a staple of UK innovation response to net zero by 2050 over the next 30 years.

Brief Description of Requirement
Innovate UK is the UK's national innovation agency. We support business-led innovation in all sectors, technologies and UK regions. We will help the UK achieve a net zero carbon economy in 2050 and better protect the environment. We aim to help the UK become a global leader in transitioning to a net zero economy by building a coherent, supportive environment enabling people and businesses to innovate. 
 
We face a time limited challenge to achieve net zero by 2050 and recognise the opportunity for businesses to grow to significantly impact this and offer global solutions. Innovative scalable net zero businesses and solutions are needed to reach our net zero targets, however there is a market failure that will prevent many of them from reaching maturity. 
 
Innovate UK wants to convene, create dialogue and action by bringing together the net zero innovation and sector specific investment and procurement communities to accelerate adoption at scale and sector investment.  We want to deliver a programme of events and activities that;
-	provide opportunities for net zero businesses to engage relevant investors
-	give investors insight on market opportunities in the net zero sector
-	unlock barriers for net zero businesses to grow and scale, and
-	enhance the net zero innovation ecosystem. 
 
We are seeking an external partner to design, develop and deliver this 2 Â½ year programme in partnership with Innovate UK, Innovate UK KTN and Innovate UK EDGE. This programme should be delivered with the ambition to grow to be a staple of UK innovation response to net zero by 2050 over the next 30 years.

Ventilator Challenge Agreement for the Manufacture and Supply of Ventilators Smiths ParaPac 300,Contract,Crown Commercial Service,Awarded,2023-02-28T14:30:46Z,Ventilator Challenge Agreement for the Manufacture and Supply of Ventilators Smiths ParaPac 300,"The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (Covid-19).

In March 2020, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.

For the Smiths Parapac 300, the original contract value was GBP 34 007 542.00. The contract was awarded for 4 418 ventilators, however these volumes were not achieved in the time frames given, therefore the spend to date is GBP 25 500 000.00 (ex.

RMVS CANs

Existing CANs relating to the RMVS project are 2020/S 100-243206, 2020/S 167-406004 and 2021/S 002-003456 (RMVS CANs).

Due to the need to respond rapidly to the emerging situation, some design work, testing, developing and manufacturing was undertaken before a formalised contract with known costs and outputs was put in place between Cabinet Office and those RMVS suppliers at the time of the RMVS CANs.

Instead Cabinet Office gave commitments to those RMVS suppliers to enable those suppliers to support the RMVS project at significant pace and to mitigate those suppliers operating entirely at risk during extremely turbulent and changing circumstances. The RMVS CANs reflected the estimated values as best known at the time and cost caps within which suppliers were operating.

At the time of the RMVS CANs, in order to be as transparent as possible with the market, information available at the time of entering into those commitments was provided, notwithstanding that it was expected to take several months to settle on the final output and resulting contracts.

The RMVS CANs were therefore published to notify the market of the estimated and maximum limits of the commitments Cabinet Office had entered into to support the RMVS project. Where a supplier appears on more than one RMVS CAN, this reflects an increase to the estimate or cost cap previously notified to the market.

The NHS Plan also promises to increase alternative forms of provision for those in crisis. Sanctuaries, safe havens and crisis cafes provide a more suitable alternative to A&E for many people experiencing mental health crisis, usually for people whose needs are escalating to crisis point, or who are experiencing a crisis, but do not necessarily have medical needs that require A&E admission

Community crisis alternative services are commissioned through the NHS and local authorities, provided at relatively low costs, high satisfaction, and usually delivered by voluntary sector partners.
Models such as crisis houses and acute day care services, host families and clinical decision units can also prevent admission. The NHS will work hand in hand with the voluntary sector and local authorities on these alternatives and ensuring they meet the needs of patients, carers and families.
The Clinical Review of Standards makes recommendations for embedding urgent and emergency mental health in waiting time standards. This means that everyone who needs it can expect to receive timely care in the most appropriate setting, whether that is through NHS 111, accessing a liaison mental health service in A&E, or a community-based crisis service.

CSW-JETS is a sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend. Since February 2010, Coventry; Solihull; Warwickshire; Nuneaton and Bedworth; Rugby alongside other local district Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. In conjunction with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal.

This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available including this tender. In addition, we will be able to access your details whenever we have a requirement, and you may then be invited to tender or quote for work.

Is a Recurrent Procurement Type? : No","NUN - Mobile Home Supply Concession Contract Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council has recently completed groundworks to extend their Mobile Home Park on Bradestone Road, Nuneaton. This concession contract is for the supply and sale (inclusive of all marketing, sales and property transfer services) of mobile homes to this site. There is a mix of new and existing plots that will be made available, an estimated total of 14-20 plots over the lifetime of the contract. 
      
      Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council are now seeking a partnering supplier to lead and assist in the advertisement, sales, legalities, construction and siting of mobile homes to the site. This will be based on a concession fee to be calculated as a percentage share of the gross sale proceeds of a mobile home being payable by the supplier to Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council. 
      
      The Contract period is for an initial 2 years with an optional extension period for a further 12 months  solely at the Council's discretion, and will be dependent on the successful bidder's performance and the demand of sales.

This is a one-off project estimated to last two years (subject to the Council's sole option to terminate in whole or part at the end of Year 1 on at least one months' notice if the Council is not in receipt of or only partially receive the final year of UKSPF where there is a failure to meet outcomes and targets and no realistic plan to address underperformance).

The allocated revenue funding is intended to cover the costs of additional Business Advisory Support Capacity, any lead generation activities and travel expenses over the lifetime of the project and the capital funding is intended to support the cost of any equipment needed, together with a number of capital grants to businesses etc.  Basildon Council would envisage working with the nominated supplier to agree the precise nature and structure of the grant award programme once supplier is appointed. 

The provider will be expected to generate sufficient leads to achieve the contractual targets set out within the service specification, although the Council may also be able to support with some marketing and promotion.  

For example, in response to the situation described above, Basildon  Council has been undertaking a pilot project to explore whether we could offer additional support to companies that we have identified as being 'In Distress' and those with 'Scaleup Potential', and we would envisage these companies being particularly good beneficiaries to target with the additional business advisory support capacity we put in place through this contract. 

This project is funded by the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. The contractor will need to have regard to the UKSPF Prospectus and Additional Guidance https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-additional-information  when delivering this project to ensure that Basildon Borough Council can comply with the reporting and performance management, monitoring and evaluation, assurance and risk and branding and publicity guidelines. Basildon Borough's UKSPF Investment Plans can be found at https://basildon.gov.uk/article/9154/Basildon-for-Business-The-UK-Shared-Prosperity-Fund-UKSPF.

Basildon Council requires a specialist organisation to deliver free business support across Basildon Borough for a period of up to two years for the purpose of increasing the number of businesses accessing support services from within the Borough. This will include a series of targeted interventions to raise the profile of the available support, such as (as a minimum) workshops, webinars, targeted marketing campaigns and drop-in sessions.

The current platform is hosted on an NTU shared server, however there is the option to be hosted by the supplier.

The system enables us to engage with and track over 10,000 students / staff, and the local community that participate in our programmes. We analyse a significant amount data from the Leisure Management System that provides insight to support our decision making. 

We are conducting this exercise to allow us to better understand our options for the procurement and implementation of suitable software that will meet ours and our customers needs, and are in line with the university foundations to be innovative and digitally sophisticated.

At this stage we will not be formally assessing proposals, so nothing provided at this stage will be evaluated as part of any future procurement process. We welcome responses from organisations who feel that they have ideas on how our vision can be delivered, and comment on the extent to which our requirements are reasonable, realistic, and properly specified. If you feel your organisation can contribute to this exercise, please email Lewis Simpson to request a document containing further details. Please provide responses to the questions in the document and return it via email to lewis.simpson@ntu.ac.uk no later than 12:00 on Thursday 30th September 2021.

Following receipt of the responses, and depending on the information we obtain from this exercise, we may invite a selection of respondents to attend separate workshop sessions to present and discuss their responses between Monday 18th October and Friday 22nd October 2021. 

Organisations not attending a session will not be disadvantaged in any future procurement, as this pre-procurement market engagement is only an exploratory fact-finding exercise: it is not an invitation to tender or a request for formal expressions of interest. Any supplier invited to present or provide information to NTU is doing so to support pre-procurement market research only, to help make any future procurement more focused and efficient, and to clarify NTU's requirements. The expected formal procurement process will start only after completion of this pre-procurement market engagement or soft market testing exercise.

WMCA intends to select a supplier in line with this process to design, build, test, operate and maintain a system and supporting business processes for the provision of services in relation to the West Midlands e-scooter Hire Services. We seek these outcomes from the tendering process:

- A new services concession agreement with an e-scooter service provider, who will take full responsibility for implementation and operation up to 31st October 2025; and

- Deployment of up to 7,500 fully managed e-scooters, generating a net income for the region.

IT-521-24-Ref: 2023-Mar-01 - AWARD,Contract,National Museums Liverpool,Awarded,2023-04-27T15:09:16+01:00,Tender for Visitor Profiling Service - AWARD,"At National Museums Liverpool (NML) we have diverse audiences that attend our seven core venues, with over three million visitors a year. We are seeking an insights and analysis company that can deliver a customer profiling service to report on our audience demographics, measure our economic impact, rate our facilities and rate quality of visit.
      
      We want to deeply understand our visitors, therefore, it is imperative that the successful tenderer has a forward-looking approach to behavioural science in measuring the sentiment and psychology of our visitors' experience. They will be required to provide a functioning framework in which the overall enjoyment of a visit can be measured and then broken down into talking points for internal evaluation.
      
      We require least some of the data to be collected from in person interviews, however, this can be supported by online surveys, if needed.  Currently, as a minimum we require a survey round once each month at World Museum, Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Museum of Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, Sudley House and Lady Lever Art Gallery.
      
      The contract duration is for an initial period of 2 years with the option to extend for three 12 monthly periods (up until 31 March 2028).  The estimated contract value for the initial period until 31 March 2025 is approximated to be up to Â£60,000 excluding VAT (or Â£72,000 GBP including VAT); and over the full potential term until 31 March 2028, approximated to be up to Â£150,000 excluding VAT; (or Â£180,000 including VAT).

We are seeking an insights and analysis company that can deliver a customer profiling service to report on our audience demographics, measure our economic impact, rate our facilities and rate quality of visit.
      
      We want to deeply understand our visitors, therefore, it is imperative that the successful tenderer has a forward-looking approach to behavioural science in measuring the sentiment and psychology of our visitors' experience. They will be required to provide a functioning framework in which the overall enjoyment of a visit can be measured and then broken down into talking points for internal evaluation.
      
      We require least some of the data to be collected from in person interviews, however, this can be supported by online surveys, if needed.  Currently, as a minimum we require a survey round once each month at World Museum, Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Museum of Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, Sudley House and Lady Lever Art Gallery.

tender_196344/825033,Contract,Highways England,Awarded,2019-12-24T10:35:50Z,Highways England Vehicle Recovery Contract (2020 - 2027),"This renewal contract is primarily to provide Highways England with a statutory removal service for the removal of accident damaged, broken down or abandoned vehicles from the strategic road network (SRN) in England. Removals are focused on those parts of the strategic road network patrolled by the Traffic Officer Service, who have the powers sanctioned within the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles (Traffic Officers) (England) Regulations 2008 to effect statutory removals. The appointed contractor will be responsible for the recovery of statutory charges for Highways England from those vehicles removed in accordance with the Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles (Prescribed Sums and Charges) Regulations 2008. Highways England will use income recovered from statutory charges (less a deduction to fund its own internal administration costs) to pay the appointed contractor, so that this statutory removal service is self-funding.

Innovate UK KTN - stand design and build for Innovation Zero,Contract,KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER NETWORK LIMITED,Closed,2023-02-20T12:17:51Z,Innovate UK KTN - exhibition stand design and build,"Innovate UK KTN exists to connect innovators with new partners and new opportunities beyond their existing thinking - accelerating ambitious ideas into real-world solutions. 

Innovate UK KTN is looking to appoint a suitably qualified exhibition design company to design, manufacture install and derig an exhibition stand for the Innovation Zero Congress (https://www.innovationzero.com/welcome-to-innovation-zero) on 24-25 May in Olympia, London. 

We expect to work closely with the chosen company to develop and realise the stand in a creative, eco-conscious and impactful way that is relevant and accessible to our audiences. 

Innovate UK is organising a cross-government stand with representatives from multiple organisations. Innovate UK KTN will be leading on the design and build and management of the stand. 

This is a two-day, b2b clean tech congress which aims to accelerate business action towards Net Zero commitments. There are two spaces of 72sqm (6x12m) each.  The attached floor plan shows the current exhibition layout. There is a main gangway between the two spaces.  

The spaces should meet the objectives outlined below, appeal to the specific target audiences and meet our requirements for brand visibility. 
The objectives of the stand are to: 
â€¢	Showcase Innovate UK - the UK's innovation agency
â€¢	Put the agencies involved at the heart of the race to achieve Net Zero
â€¢	Create an audience experience which encourages engagement and interaction
â€¢	Create a stand-journey that furthers the audience's understanding of the different agencies and their contribution to the race for Net Zero
â€¢	Deliver a clear vision of all Innovate UK services
â€¢	Showcase how Innovate UK supports innovation via live demonstrations/exhibits

The theme for the stand will be worked on with the chosen supplier but as a guide should include: 
â€¢	Net Zero - a future of opportunity
â€¢	Creating a better future by investing in innovation

This will be an opportunity for significant brand positioning and awareness for Innovate UK and display of its brand must be a primary consideration.  

Following sign-off of detailed designs, the agency will undertake production design and specification of all exhibition elements. The materials selected should demonstrate best-practice in Net Zero and sustainability and consider reuse or recycling. The build must be durable and easy to clean. The structures must be compliant with relevant statutory and non-statutory requirements e.g. Health & Safety regulations, Equality Act legislation, be constructed of fire retardant materials and follow best practice procedures. 

All rights (including ownership and copyright) will pass to Innovate UK KTN on completion of this project.

The site is located at 10 Ladybank, Bracknell RG12 7HA off Birch Hill Road and is situated close to a medical practice, shops, community centre and a primary school.
The site is accessed via Ladybank Road, a no-through road. The surrounding area is predominantly residential. Temporary access for construction may also be possible from Leppington Road (north of the site), subject to seeking Highways consent.
Part of the site slopes from west to east, with the existing building situated on a levelled surface. The proposed new building is planned to remain around the same level of the existing building. For further details, please refer to the IBI architect's RIBA Stage 2 report.
The Bridgewell Supported Living project will provide four 5-bedroom units and is based on a two-storey new build accommodation, i.e. the existing building will be demolished. The scheme will achieve BREEAM Excellent sustainability and secure by design rating. The design is based on Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation (HAPPI).
In summary, the works involve the following: -
1)	Complete RIBA Stages 3 and 4 design under a PCSA. 
2)	Site perimeter hoarding.
3)	Isolation and capping of existing services.
4)	Asbestos removal.
5)	Soft strip.
6)	Full demolition of the existing buildings on site and adjust levels to the site.
7)	Construction of a new two storey supported living residential accommodation with a roof garden. BREEAM Excellent target.
8)	Landscaping works including access, car parking, pedestrian routes, garden & planting works and making good. 
9)	Adjustment of hoardings and boundary.

This project will be developed under a Design and Build (D&B) process i.e. the contract sum for the Main Works Contract (the ""Contract Sum"") will be arrived at in two stages. The intention is that the selected Contractor will initially fulfil the design for RIBA stages 3 and 4 under a Pre-Construction Services Agreement and ultimately be appointed under a lump sum form of contract (JCT Design and Build 2016 as amended by The Schedule of Amendments) (the ""Main Works Contract"").  A summary of this process is set out in the Combined Invitation to Tender.

The Authority is the UK Government Department responsible for the environment, food, farming and rural affairs (Defra). Further information on the Authority can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs

This document sets out the strategy for procuring the project titled ""Discovery of Recent Changes in Consumer Behaviour around Food Information (Food Information to Consumers [FIC])"".

In 2011, the European Union (EU) passed Regulation No. 1169/2011 on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (EU FIC Regulation).  This regulation required member states to modify existing food labelling regulations, with the aim of: 

1) Enabling consumers to make more informed choices; 
2) Increasing the safe use of food; and 
3) Ensuring the free movement of legally produced and marketed food, within the EU. 

The Withdrawal Act retained Regulation No. 1169/2011 into UK law.  

In 2014 and 2018, Defra commissioned two studies in succession to establish a baseline against which the effect of changes brought in by the EU FIC Regulation could be tracked and to review the extent of how the objectives of EU FIC have been achieved. 

We are now commissioning new research to provide an update assessing the impact of the FIC regulation and to measure recent changes in consumer behaviour and business activity bought about by recent legislative, societal, and technological changes. The evidence will be used to underpin food labelling policy development.

The Secretary of State for Education determined that there should be a 'transitional' (short-term) procurement based on current AEB policy to support learners until Further Education (FE) Reform policy embeds and to provide access for learners to the new National Skills Fund Level 3 adult offer. This procurement, for the 2021/22 academic year, will ensure continued access to funds for providers who have an important role in the adult education market helping to deliver the government's education and skills priorities and ensuring full coverage across England. It will also provide opportunities to support some of the policies associated with post Covid-19 economic recovery.

As a consequence of Covid-19, unemployment is expected to rise. The cohort of unemployed adults is now different compared to pre-Covid-19; many of them have skills and work experience but need support retraining and upskilling into sustainable, productive employment and the jobs of the future. Covid-19 has therefore expedited the need for people to reskill into sustainable, productive employment.

The Services to be delivered under the Contracts will support Covid-19 recovery and will be focused to support skills which boost productivity and enhance the adult skills system.",10:00,73930858.0,12753073.01,4066197.19,4620678.625,4066197.19,5729641.495,1848271.45,3881370.045,1530368.761,487943.6628,554481.435,487943.6628,687556.9794,221792.574,465764.4054,36728850.25,11710647.91,13307554.44,11710647.91,16501367.51,5323021.776,11178345.73,13407361.1,4188183.106,4990332.915,4228845.078,7428202.958,5672345.08,1755857.878,1712460.464,590411.832,526757.3633,595291.2686,995848.6573,756312.6773,239535.9799,45123255.6,12998819.18,16900594.14,15223842.28,24044089.36,17656463.23,6387626.131,92711218.13,"The Authority will be administering the procurement process electronically via Jaggaer, the Authority e-Procurement Solution (e-PS) portal.

SCCL is responsible for driving commercial objectives, managing Category Management Service Providers, and enabling services whilst overseeing continuous improvement.

By 2022/2023 we aim to save the NHS Â£2.4bn by leveraging the scale of the NHS to drive savings and provide a standardised range of quality assured clinical products that meet the diverse needs of the NHS across all areas.

NHS Supply Chain provides a leading procurement and supply chain services to hospitals and healthcare providers, to help leverage national expenditure whilst providing a resilient, sustainable national supply chain. The organisation is at exciting cross-roads, having recently defined a new 10-year vision to enable it to better meet the needs of the NHS and bring its value proposition to a broader range of healthcare
providers. It currently provides (B2B) services to almost all Trusts in England, as well as operating a small but critical and growing home delivery (B2B2C) business. This increased diversity of customers lays the foundations for future requirements for the business, as healthcare becomes more integrated regionally, through integrated care systems (ICS).

NHS Supply Chain captures customer demand through a range of solutions including a core catalogue, EDI order feeds, through a forecast driven automated replenishment model, and through orders triggered by inventory usage (e.g., in theatres for high value products). Some of these solutions are over 30 years old, unstable, aren't flexible and are unable to adapt to our strategy or external changes.

The organisation is at a relatively early stage of a 3 - 5 year transformation to re-platform its core Front Office and Digital Commerce solutions, and dramatically improve the user experience and interface to offer an experience which is comparable to those offered by for example leading retailers. NHS Supply Chain's
mission is to provide the NHS with a modern and intuitive ordering experience to increase Customer satisfaction, make it easier for the NHS to put Patients first and be flexible to adapt to the changing needs of the NHS. Modernisation is also an imperative part of our longer-term vision to be easy to work with and enable further adoption of NHS Supply Chain's services.

In order to deliver upon the Mission, NHS Supply Chain are seeking an eCommerce Solution and Delivery partner to provide a single tailored and intuitive ordering platform, managing personalised content delivery across web and mobile channels whilst supporting integration with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and 3rd
party platforms.

TRN 2126/11/2019,Contract,Business Energy and Industrial Strategy,Awarded,2020-06-01T11:46:57+01:00,Cost Optimal Domestic Electrification (CODE),"The Department is looking to commission a detailed modelling study to help answer the question of what is the cost optimal combination of energy efficiency measures and low carbon electric heating technologies to decarbonise the energy used for heating in homes in England and Wales.  

To help answer this question the Department would like to develop a suite of dynamic building models representing the vast majority of different dwelling types in England and Wales. We would expect these models to be able to model complex building physics and in particular, the thermal interaction between the fabric and ventilation of the building and the heating system installed through an annual cycle.  

These models would then be used to answer a series of research questions associated with the overarching question of determining the cost optimal combination of measures to decarbonise homes with electric heating technologies. These questions will include understanding the flexibility potential that the building as a system can provide to the electricity network.  

The outputs from this analysis will then be simplified and incorporated into more simplified building stock models used by the Department (the National Household Model (NHM)), to scale up the findings from the dynamic models to the entire housing stock.  

Outputs from the study will be disseminated to BEIS and other relevant stakeholders and the models developed will be handed over to the BEIS Central Modelling Team. A Call off Contract will then come into effect following the end of the core contract, providing technical modelling support to the Department on an ad hoc basis. For example, this could be technical support to change variables in the models or adding additional technology modules.",,,United Kingdom,73000000,,oliver.sutton@beis.gov.uk,1 Victoria Street,,London,SW1H0ET,England,2072150823,,,,,18/03/2020,31/03/2021,31/01/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,99630.0,,21/02/2020,99630.0,"[Cambridge Architectural Research (CAR)|Cambridge Architectural Research (CAR)

To help answer this question the Department would like to develop a suite of dynamic building models representing the vast majority of different dwelling types in England and Wales. We would expect these models to be able to model complex building physics and in particular, the thermal interaction between the fabric and ventilation of the building and the heating system installed through an annual cycle.  

These models would then be used to answer a series of research questions associated with the overarching question of determining the cost optimal combination of measures to decarbonise homes with electric heating technologies. These questions will include understanding the flexibility potential that the building as a system can provide to the electricity network.  

The outputs from this analysis will then be simplified and incorporated into more simplified building stock models used by the Department (the National Household Model (NHM)), to scale up the findings from the dynamic models to the entire housing stock.  

Outputs from the study will be disseminated to BEIS and other relevant stakeholders and the models developed will be handed over to the BEIS Central Modelling Team. A Call off Contract will then come into effect following the end of the core contract, providing technical modelling support to the Department on an ad hoc basis. For example, this could be technical support to change variables in the models or adding additional technology modules. "

- consumers with food hypersensitivities (FHS consumers), who were the intended beneficiaries of the changes.
- food business operators (FBOs), who are responsible for implementing the changes within their businesses.
- local authorities (LAs), who are responsible for monitoring FBO compliance with food safety regulations, of which PPDS is one part. "

HEE001-DN353397-58467365,Contract,Health Education England,Awarded,2018-12-01T11:56:11Z,Writing and Editing Services for the Genomics Education Programme,"HEE GEP requires the provision of Writing and Editing to the specification and scope as outlined below.

The primary objective of this procurement is to obtain specialist genomics editorial expertise to plan and produce a series of well-written and edited articles on genomics in healthcare that are useful and relevant to our audience groups, to be featured on our website's blog.

Current process in place 

Broadly speaking, the GEP blog contains two types of articles:

ï‚§	GEP and partner/stakeholder news and events updates, written by the GEP team; and
ï‚§	educational articles, to which this procurement relates. 

The educational articles are intended for a range of health professionals, from those with no or limited understanding of genomics but keen to learn more, to those who work in a specialist genomics role but are interested in reading about new developments and trends in the context of the NHS. 

As a result, while the aim of these articles is to be written in an accessible way for non-experts in genomics, we do sometimes cover quite complex topics, eg genome editing. We also feature more technical pieces, written by guest expert authors. 

Expected requirements

The expectation is that the chosen provider will offer HEE GEP the benefits of specialist genomics editorial expertise including but not limited to these key areas:

â€¢	Provision of articles: The provider will submit a high-quality article to the GEP on a weekly basis* that fulfils the service requirements. Typically, the article will be emailed to the GEP by close of business on a Thursday, for publication on the GEP blog the following Monday. The provider will supply:
o	approximately 3 articles per month of 500+ words each written by the provider, covering a range of topics and article types (see 'Topic planning' below); and
o	1 expert article per month of 800+ words, written by an external author, typically a senior health professional working in genomics (authors to be confirmed in advance by the GEP).
* One article per week will be provided, with the exception of a 2-week break over Christmas. So, for example, if the contract begins on 1st September 2018, there would be 28 articles delivered in the 8 months to 31st March 2019, comprising 21 provider articles and 7 expert articles. In any month where an expert author is unable to provide an article and no replacement expert author can be found in time, the provider will write a replacement article of 500+ words, and the expert author's fee will be allocated to the provider. 

â€¢	Editorial management: The provider will manage the editorial process to a high-quality standard, from developing the brief through to researching, writing and editing each article. As well as writing articles in-house, the provider will act as a commissioning editor for the external expert authors (typically individuals working in the NHS that have been identified by the GEP as being a suitable contributor).

1.	Apprenticeships covering various Schools in NTU
2.	Further Education (post 16) Apprenticeships which are mainly based out at the Brackenhurst Campus

The risk of compliance and quality failure is high as a direct result of the current systems landscape and the surrounding processes. 

Ofsted reputational damage is key, and a negative Ofsted audit would be followed up with further audits from Ofsted and the ESFA.  
In addition to this, our volume of apprenticeships, both in courses and student numbers has grown whilst our systems haven't matured to cope with this increase - and this increase is set to continue with the apprenticeship program being an area of growth for the University.

For the previous 2 years we have had a 7% growth which looks set to continue this year. The official target planning numbers for 23/24 are 540 new apprentices, but we will likely add additional courses to support local and regional business needs, particularly for the NHS.
 
It is very challenging for colleagues managing the data due to so many sources and places it is kept, impacting consistent processing and accurate reporting. 

Resulting Risk - We get funding removed if we cannot provide the correct information i.e. An ESFA audit failure could result in clawback of funds.

Resulting Risk - Reputational damage to NTU from poor Ofsted ratings impacting employer and apprentice uptake.

Barking and Dagenham Council is committed to building a more inclusive economy that offers more and better jobs for residents.
In the coming years, the development of the borough's food sector will be a key focus - catalysed by efforts to ensure the planned relocation of the City of London's historic wholesale meat, fish, and fruit and vegetable markets (Smithfield, Billingsgate and New Spitalfields) to Dagenham Dock lead to wider social and economic benefits. 

As part of the new market build, the City of London Corporation (COLC) and the Council share a commitment to food education and the establishment of a new Food School on the new site at Dagenham Dock as well as complementary activity in Barking Town Centre. This work seeks to support the curriculum development for the Barking Food School and develop the industry partnerships and knowledge to ensure it meets the needs of the sector - with a focus on sustainable and world cuisine, which is under-served by mainstream food colleges. 

We are looking for an organisation/company to help us:
- Understand the food sector skills gap, particularly around world cuisine and innovative approaches to low-waste, low-carbon restaurants/catering.
- Develop links with industry that could lead to ongoing involvement with the Food School e.g. offering careers activities, work experience, apprenticeships and training placements with a clear line of sight to work, as part of our schools programmes or the FE/HE programmes of our partners, guest speakers on courses, financial or promotional support of the Food School.
- Develop a clear set of pathways into the sector, including courses and new curricula where necessary that speak to the skills gaps identified by the industry and that will help our young people access exciting, well-paid jobs in the industry.

We are looking for a research partner or partners with demonstrable understanding of the borough and the London-wide food industry, and demonstrable expertise in curriculum development and skills pathways. The work will include mapping, research, industry engagement and curriculum development.
Please find more information in the attached documents and apply using the bespoke application form.

Rapid Manufacture Ventilator System-Direct purchase agreement for Prima ES02 model 10000 Units,Contract,Crown Commercial Service,Awarded,2023-02-28T15:04:10Z,Rapid Manufacture Ventilator System-Direct purchase agreement for Prima ES02 model 10000 Units,"The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (Covid-19).

In March 2020, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.",,,United Kingdom,33170000,,cco@cabinetoffice.gov.uk,39 Old Hall Street,,Liverpool,L39PP,England,+44 08009981098,www.gov.uk/ccs,"200329 - Penlon Limited Confirmation of Order for 10,000 Units (Ref_1044)_Redacted.pdf Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 201424EU (1) (1).pdf ",https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/005875-2023 ,"This contract was awarded as a result of the RMVS project.

RMVS CANs

Existing CANs relating to the RMVS project are 2020/S 100-243206, 2020/S 167-406004 and 2021/S 002-003456 (RMVS CANs).

Due to the need to respond rapidly to the emerging situation, some design work, testing, developing and manufacturing was undertaken before a formalised contract with known costs and outputs was put in place between Cabinet Office and those RMVS suppliers at the time of the RMVS CANs.

Instead Cabinet Office gave commitments to those RMVS suppliers to enable those suppliers to support the RMVS project at significant pace and to mitigate those suppliers operating entirely at risk during extremely turbulent and changing circumstances. The RMVS CANs reflected the estimated values as best known at the time and cost caps within which suppliers were operating.

At the time of the RMVS CANs, in order to be as transparent as possible with the market, information available at the time of entering into those commitments was provided, notwithstanding that it was expected to take several months to settle on the final output and resulting contracts.

The RMVS CANs were therefore published to notify the market of the estimated and maximum limits of the commitments Cabinet Office had entered into to support the RMVS project. Where a supplier appears on more than one RMVS CAN, this reflects an increase to the estimate or cost cap previously notified to the market.

RMVS CANs

Existing CANs relating to the RMVS project are 2020/S 100-243206, 2020/S 167-406004 and 2021/S 002-003456 (RMVS CANs).

Due to the need to respond rapidly to the emerging situation, some design work, testing, developing and manufacturing was undertaken before a formalised contract with known costs and outputs was put in place between Cabinet Office and those RMVS suppliers at the time of the RMVS CANs.

Instead Cabinet Office gave commitments to those RMVS suppliers to enable those suppliers to support the RMVS project at significant pace and to mitigate those suppliers operating entirely at risk during extremely turbulent and changing circumstances. The RMVS CANs reflected the estimated values as best known at the time and cost caps within which suppliers were operating.

At the time of the RMVS CANs, in order to be as transparent as possible with the market, information available at the time of entering into those commitments was provided, notwithstanding that it was expected to take several months to settle on the final output and resulting contracts.

The RMVS CANs were therefore published to notify the market of the estimated and maximum limits of the commitments Cabinet Office had entered into to support the RMVS project. Where a supplier appears on more than one RMVS CAN, this reflects an increase to the estimate or cost cap previously notified to the market.

This contract is the Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) resulting from the support by Penlon Ltd to the RMVS project and which is the output of Penlon Ltd appearing on 2020/S 100-243206 of the RMVS CANs.","Rapid Manufacture Ventilator System-Direct purchase agreement for Prima ES02 model 10000 Units The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (Covid-19).

In March 2020, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad. This contract was awarded as a result of the RMVS project.

CF-0024300D8d000003VQwdEAG,Contract,DEFRA,Closed,2022-12-29T15:23:17Z,Nature for Climate Paludiculture Exploration Fund,"The Paludiculture Exploration Fund (PEF) is a new grant scheme sitting under the umbrella of the Nature for Climate Peatland Grant Scheme (NCPGS) managed and delivered by Natural England.
PEF Grants are to help unlock barriers to the development of commercially viable paludiculture. The focus of the grants offered through PEF is tackling both ends of the supply chain, i.e., the growing and harvesting of paludiculture crops and/or the development of products based on those crops. Land-based projects (including machinery development) must take place on lowland peat soils in England.

PEF Grants are to help unlock barriers to the development of commercially viable paludiculture. The focus of the grants offered through PEF is tackling both ends of the supply chain, i.e., the growing and harvesting of paludiculture crops and/or the development of products based on those crops. Land-based projects (including machinery development) must take place on lowland peat soils in England. Product development projects must be based in England, but the paludicultural crops used to develop the product can be sourced from further afield if sufficient supplies cannot be sourced in England.

PR001938 Award,Contract,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",Awarded,2018-11-29T11:35:32Z,NHS E South (South Central) - Provision of Liaison & Diversion Services across the Thames Valley,"NHS England Health & Justice Team (South Central Region) wish to recommission Liaison and Diversion services across the Thames Valley Police Force area. The service will aim to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for children, young people and adults who come into contact with the youth and criminal justice systems.
Liaison and Diversion (L&D) services aim to provide early intervention for vulnerable individuals (both young people and adults) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  L&D services provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, probation service, youth offending teams or court staff, and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing these vulnerable people.  L&D also acts as a point of referral and assertive follow up for these service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, further help. 
The Thames Valley area has a population of 2,358,564 and, whilst there has been partial coverage of L&D across the force footprint, this has not to date covered the full area for both adults and young people. 
A prior information/early engagement notice was published in relation to this procurement in April 2017, seeking expressions of interest. Please note that this previous notice was an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right. Although those who responded to that notice will be advised that this contract notice has been published, there will be no process exemptions or preferential treatment afforded to any parties who expressed an interest at that stage.
The maximum annual contract value will be Â£2,800,000. The contract duration will be three years (with the option to extend by up to a further two years), due to commence on 01/04/18.
Commissioners will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this process.
Interested parties who wish to take part in the procurement are invited to take part in an Invitation To Tender (ITT) process, based on the Open procedure and designed to identify the Most Economically Advantageous Tender and therefore determine the incoming provider. 
The procurement will be conducted via the In-Tend portal, and can be accessed via the 'current tenders' list on https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home
In order to access the tender documentation, you will need to 'express an interest' and register on the system for full access. Bidders are required to respond to questions directly within In-Tend and attach any requested documents separately to the placeholders provided.
All ITT responses must be returned by 12 Noon on 6th September 2017, at the latest.",,,South East,85000000,Tom Griffiths,scwcsu.procurement@nhs.net,South Plaza,Marlborough Street,Bristol,BS1 3NX,England,,,,,"In the interest of encouraging collaborative working, any organisation who do not wish to bid for the entire contract, but would like their details to be shared with potential bidders as either subcontractors or potential consortium partners should send contact details to ashley.preece@nhs.net at their earliest convenience, these will be circulated via the In-Tend portal.

The service will aim to improve health and criminal justice outcomes for children, young people and adults who come into contact with the youth and criminal justice systems.
Liaison and Diversion (L&D) services aim to provide early intervention for vulnerable individuals (both young people and adults) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  L&D services provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, probation service, youth offending teams or court staff, and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing these vulnerable people.  L&D also acts as a point of referral and assertive follow up for these service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, further help. 
The Thames Valley area has a population of 2,358,564 and, whilst there has been partial coverage of L&D across the force footprint, this has not to date covered the full area for both adults and young people. 
A prior information/early engagement notice was published in relation to this procurement in April 2017, seeking expressions of interest. Please note that this previous notice was an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right. Although those who responded to that notice will be advised that this contract notice has been published, there will be no process exemptions or preferential treatment afforded to any parties who expressed an interest at that stage.
The maximum annual contract value will be Â£2,800,000. The contract duration will be three years (with the option to extend by up to a further two years), due to commence on 01/04/18.
Commissioners will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this process.
Interested parties who wish to take part in the procurement are invited to take part in an Invitation To Tender (ITT) process, based on the Open procedure and designed to identify the Most Economically Advantageous Tender and therefore determine the incoming provider. 
The procurement will be conducted via the In-Tend portal, and can be accessed via the 'current tenders' list on https://in-tendhost.co.uk/scwcsu/aspx/Home
In order to access the tender documentation, you will need to 'express an interest' and register on the system for full access. Bidders are required to respond to questions directly within In-Tend and attach any requested documents separately to the placeholders provided.
All ITT responses must be returned by 12 Noon on 6th September 2017, at the latest. In the interest of encouraging collaborative working, any organisation who do not wish to bid for the entire contract, but would like their details to be shared with potential bidders as either subcontractors or potential consortium partners should send contact details to ashley.preece@nhs.net at their earliest convenience, these will be circulated via the In-Tend portal.

20230601160919-53042,Contract,University of Exeter,Closed,2023-06-01T16:09:25+01:00,Whole genome sequencing services,"A team of academics from the University of Exeter (Faculty of Health and Life Sciences) have funding from Diabetes UK and the Wellcome Trust to perform whole genome sequencing on patients with early-onset/neonatal diabetes, syndromic diabetes and Hyperinsulinism. 

The aim of this work is to identify mutations in novel genes and non-coding regions causing these diseases.

The University of Exeter intends to award a contract to a single supplier for 12-months, with the option to extend by 3 further 12-month periods, to provide human whole genome sequencing services to at least 30X average coverage. It is highly desirable that these services use either of the University's preferred sequencing technology: Illumina or BGI sequencing. This is due to the established bioinformatics and analysis pipelines using these technologies. 

These samples are from our Genetic Beta-Cell biobank of patients with suspected monogenic forms of diabetes or hyperinsulinism. Bidders using alternative technology may submit a bid, however, must be able to provide the University with assurance that equivalent results/data will be produced.

Via this funding route, the University expects to be able to provide between 100 and 200 samples per annum, to be sent to the supplier in batches throughout a 12-month period. The average number of samples submitted per annum for sequencing over the previous 5-year period is 131, however, please note that these figures are provided for indicative purposes only and are subject to increase/decrease dependent on research requirements. 

A second funding application has been submitted to increase the scale of the above research. If this is successful, the University may require whole genome sequencing services for a further 1824 samples over a two-year period. However, this is subject to the application being successful and the University can make no commitment to these volumes.

In England, teachers are required to make statutory teacher assessment judgements for pupils at the end of key stage 2* (year 6) in English writing. In the Government response to the 2017 Primary Assessment consultation, and having listened to feedback from the schools sector, the Department for Education committed itself to exploring comparative judgement as a potential long-term alternative to the teacher assessment of writing at the end of key stage 2.


Having conducted some initial engagement with assessment experts and teaching professionals the Standards and Testing Agency, an executive agency of the Department, is now interested in speaking to comparative judgement suppliers to discuss how their systems could potentially work as the basis for a new approach to the statutory assessment of English writing. Interested Suppliers should provide their contact details (email address and telephone number) to linh.hy@education.gov.uk by Friday 11th January 2019. They will then be invited via email into the Department to meet with the STA's Policy Team in the New Year.

tender_317773/1109768,PreProcurement,Department for Education,Closed,2022-09-30T10:32:04+01:00,"PIN- iQTS inspection regime, appointment of inspectorates","This is not an invitation to bid. The purpose of this Prior Information Notice (PIN) is to invite organisations to participate in market engagement. 
International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teacher training qualification backed by the Department of Education (DfE) and the UK government. It is in pilot, with plans underway to open iQTS to increasing numbers of iQTS providers and applicants in academic year 2023/24 and 2024/25 before its full launch to the market.
DfE will soon be inviting applications from organisations with experience in quality assuring domestic and overseas education provision to become iQTS inspectorates for the iQTS inspection pilot. The pilot programme will run from January 2023 to autumn 2024. Those delivering successful pilot inspections may later be approved to inspect iQTS provision.  
The inspection framework(s) and inspection documentation will be developed from January 2023 to summer 2023 and published in autumn 2023.  The inspection visits will take place from January 2024 to July 2024. 

Requirment
DfE's International qualified teacher status (iQTS): inspection policy sets out the iQTS inspection regime. Inspection of iQTS provision must ensure that iQTS is delivered in line with the core documents:  
-	iQTS inspection criteria (setting out the standards iQTS providers will be graded on by the inspectorate will be published with the tender documentation)
-	iQTS Teacher's Standards 
-	Initial teacher training core content framework for iQTS
-	iQTS: citeria for providers  
The inspection regime will also ensure iQTS meets the needs of candidates, iQTS providers, the quality control standards set by DfE at the overall goals, as set out in &apos;Introducing international qualified teacher status (iQTS)&apos; link below.

iQTS inspections will be hybrid in nature, with evidence and data provided both in person and via remote technology. You will be expected to visit one school overseas from the provider cohort to speak to the trainees, their mentors and school leaders.  
Following the inspection, the iQTS provision will be given a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest rating and 4 the lowest.
DfE's International qualified teacher status (iQTS): inspection policy gives more detail.

Aims of the iQTS inspection pilot 
DfE intends to appoint a number of independent organisations to quality assure the iQTS training programmes delivered by 6 iQTS providers in academic year 2023/24. 
What we learn from the inspection pilot will allow us to successfully roll out the inspection regime for iQTS over the academic year 2024/25.

Funding
Please note there is no DfE funding available for iQTS inspections or the development of the deliverables listed below. iQTS providers set their own course fees and as part of this course fee they will cover the cost of their iQTS inspection.

Organisations submitting an application for the iQTS inspectorate do so at their own risk.",,,Any region,72225000 75121000 80000000 ,,iqts.pilot@education.gov.uk,Department for Education   20 Great Smith Street  London SW1P 3BT,,London,SW1P 3BT,England,,https://education.app.jaggaer.com,,Applicants can access this system at: https://education.app.jaggaer.com View collected iQTS policy and guidance: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/international-qualified-teacher-status#inspection-policy https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers/international-qualified-teacher-status https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts-inspection-policy https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts/introducing-the-international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts-pilot ,"
Eligibility
As part of the application process to become an iQTS inspectorate, you must confirm:
-	You are independent from English ITT providers and all overseas schools
-	have relevant expertise and experience of similar quality assurance work in the UK or overseas (for example, working with British Schools Overseas)

The purpose of this Prior Information Notice (PIN) is to invite organisations to participate in market engagement. 
International qualified teacher status (iQTS) is a new teacher training qualification backed by the Department of Education (DfE) and the UK government. It is in pilot, with plans underway to open iQTS to increasing numbers of iQTS providers and applicants in academic year 2023/24 and 2024/25 before its full launch to the market.
DfE will soon be inviting applications from organisations with experience in quality assuring domestic and overseas education provision to become iQTS inspectorates for the iQTS inspection pilot. The pilot programme will run from January 2023 to autumn 2024. Those delivering successful pilot inspections may later be approved to inspect iQTS provision.  
The inspection framework(s) and inspection documentation will be developed from January 2023 to summer 2023 and published in autumn 2023.  The inspection visits will take place from January 2024 to July 2024. 

Requirment
DfE's International qualified teacher status (iQTS): inspection policy sets out the iQTS inspection regime. Inspection of iQTS provision must ensure that iQTS is delivered in line with the core documents:  
-	iQTS inspection criteria (setting out the standards iQTS providers will be graded on by the inspectorate will be published with the tender documentation)
-	iQTS Teacher's Standards 
-	Initial teacher training core content framework for iQTS
-	iQTS: citeria for providers  
The inspection regime will also ensure iQTS meets the needs of candidates, iQTS providers, the quality control standards set by DfE at the overall goals, as set out in &apos;Introducing international qualified teacher status (iQTS)&apos; link below.

iQTS inspections will be hybrid in nature, with evidence and data provided both in person and via remote technology. You will be expected to visit one school overseas from the provider cohort to speak to the trainees, their mentors and school leaders.  
Following the inspection, the iQTS provision will be given a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest rating and 4 the lowest.
DfE's International qualified teacher status (iQTS): inspection policy gives more detail.

Aims of the iQTS inspection pilot 
DfE intends to appoint a number of independent organisations to quality assure the iQTS training programmes delivered by 6 iQTS providers in academic year 2023/24. 
What we learn from the inspection pilot will allow us to successfully roll out the inspection regime for iQTS over the academic year 2024/25.

Funding
Please note there is no DfE funding available for iQTS inspections or the development of the deliverables listed below. iQTS providers set their own course fees and as part of this course fee they will cover the cost of their iQTS inspection.

Organisations submitting an application for the iQTS inspectorate do so at their own risk.
